So I thought of buying this new shoe (supposedly new shoe) and I guess flipkart claims too that they sell 100% genuine and new products but the condition of the shoe which I have got is pathetic !!It doesn't even look like an original NIKE Shoe and the finishing of the shoe is disgusting!!It has glue all over the sole and near the lace the make of the shoe is so so bad that the foam is visible.Highly disappointed and dissatisfied !!,thought buying new shoe supposedly new shoe guess flipkart claims sell genuine new products condition shoe got pathetic doesnt even look like original nike shoe finishing shoe disgustingit glue sole near lace make shoe bad foam visiblehighly disappointed dissatisfied,-0.9137,negative

Effectively Nike use a call centre to process there complaints and returns and they are just given a Script and probably have nothing to do with Nike itself. I purchased a pair of trainers that fell apart after first use so I contacted them via chat as that is all you can do I was then told I could return them as they were faulty. I was sent a prepaid Royal Mail return label and sent it I then waited 5 days checked the tracking and it said it was delivered they then contacted me and said I sent an empty box which is a complete lie as I have the weight on the receipt which I sent to them and they didn’t respond I then contacted them again and they said there’s nothing they can do and won’t send a refund. So effectively they now have my trainers I sent they have refused me a refund and have called my a lier. I contacted my bank and they said it’s something they can do and are issuing a charge back on my transaction. I recommend doing this if you want your money back I hope this helps.

"Amazing experience from Nike! A website discount code would not work, so I sent Nike a tweet. They said if I put the order through on the website and send them the order number they would apply it to my order, and only deduct the discounted total from my bank. Having read all these negative trustpilot reviews I was rather dubious, but as the order was a birthday present, I went ahead and ordered. My bank account showed a pending amount without the discount, but when the amount was eventually taken from my bank, it was for the discounted total. So the discount was honoured. Delivery was also earlier then expected, so the trainers arrived well before the birthday!! I ordered on 23rd November, the birthday was on the 1st of December, trainers arrived on the 26th November! It would seem those who have a positive experience with Nike are not leaving reviews, hence all the negative reviews. So I have decided to leave an honest review to reassure buyers, it is not all bad.

It extenuates the shoulders neck and arms. It has enough body and shape that you can pair it with both tight and loose-fitting jeans. It's dope and I'm confident Kanye West would approve.I made a point to provide a review here because I read these reviews the day after my purchase, and on the strength of the dismal ratings fretted that I'd made a big mistake.

But two weeks from Europe or USA, for a clothing parcel? that's good. They provide an ETA based on your location so if you can't bear the thought of waiting 2-3 weeks then don't buy it.

But the Chinese Government of it's people needs to lay off on whomever of our tax money to what we all owe them to the IRS . Because the truth is part of my DNA is I am part European even part Asian even American citizen . So even the world we all live in needs to stop being greedy with their money . But you all are amazing . Would like to say happy once more a wonderful birthday to you Phil Knight Nike co-founder business owner . I am thrilled I got to meet you in person Phil Knight at the University of Oregon track, and field at Haward field back in 2012 of me wrapping my arms on you personally .

One thing I didn't appreciate Nike's people at there headquarters feeling like to say to me unkind we don't care if you need reasonable accommodations because of your disability for them to provide me for me to needing help filling out product questions even for knowing of how to fill out a job application . Don't get me wrong they are the best company and know when there co-founder Phil Knight former chairman whom over sees his employees and the retail employees and even consumer's affairs and whom ever of there higher up's and there management team is out standing but they as a company need to not to be a bit strick on anyone with special needs even with out special needs . I have ADA I deserve to be treated right with whom ever from Nike locations in the world I would like there security team of Nike .com and even the Nike HR people of headquarters and whom ever to agree to choose kindness to anyone in the world . But for them not to be greedy with there funds and for them all as a team to agree to leave alone the police of not calling them a lot on any one and not to be blocking people's phone calls all thee above . And there customer service people on Nike.com needs to not get people into trouble . Plus I am truly sorry for what I didn't mean to cause telephone harassment of asking Nike.com team of there management team from my past history why don't you guys don't have to what ever I couldn't find so then they would put me on hold to tell them they have it at there ware house  and they seem to tell me Steven  have you called us again well if a person is needing assistance to whatever it is that I need of my ADA. Do I feel treated unfair by Nike management team and even by the Nike employees of there Nike locations in the world . I was told by the Police in the USA they some how don't like Nike products and don't like how they as a team a bit rude to people in the world. I think Nike to all locations needs to do survey's to all locations in the world to inform anyone in all nations of how people like there products or even if people were treated kindly by Nike employees world wide of all nations as a suggestion and idea . And when buying products on Nike .com and applying for jobs please everyone from Nike and for there team world wide to know is don't say if a person continues telephone harassing you or chatting with you on chat of Nike.com you all will call the police because I was informed that the police will say to you all why are you calling us because they can be annoied by anyone in the world of calling the police a lot then you all would be harassing the police on them . So just chill out on anyone and lay off on the calling to the police and help anyone whom is in need or that is poor with no funds in there hands  help people by helping explain how your things on Nike.com works for buying things on line of if a disabled person needs help of applying for jobs never say you do it on your own because then you would be offending the person to whom ever it is . Thanks Nike.com team to all employees to approve this . I would love to be your Nike fan council to all locations for rating products of Nike.com  please consider me back and I will 100% promise and not say not to do but to agree to abide the rules please Nike employees and management team all thee above please choose kindness at all times said by congressmen of the laws of USA of 50 States . please call me if you do consider me back to your locations .

"Well I felt like Nike world head quarters said if I continued telephone harassing them of 2016 and 2017 and 2019 they were going to have the Beaverton Police detectives name Dale and his partner name John drive to Eugene Oregon and when I was told by there receptionist from the past to the beginning and said to me what do you want on the phone talking rudely to me and saying what kind of help or accommdations you need for employment so then when there security team and there HR people from Headquarters said Steven we will call you if you get offered an interview or for the job to provide you the reasonable accommodations for job tasks and even we could provide you one of our staff to work with you while you learn to do the job inside the retail store and me accendlty asking them if they can create a job called cashier assistance with helping the cashier's of helping them with putting people's things inside the Nike bag so then it could go faster for the cashier's and not waste time of whatever they are doing so when I got told by there headquarters of Nike.com management team HR we don't have that job Steven Barone American disability even letting them know I got to meet there co-founder name Phil Knight in person with me giving him a friendly hand shake and a friendly warm hug plus Phil Knight sent me a thank you letter saying to me thank you Steven for being the biggest fan of Nike and that he urged me to apply for jobs on Nike biz.com  so when I got chew up badly and poorly by the Nike employees from all locations in the world even in the USA they as a company don't like being bothered for any reason well because they get a lot of applications of people from all over the world applying for Nike jobs and they as the Nike team get a lot of phone calls plus if anyone in the world were to call Nike on themselves Nike would say on there end what do you need not in a nice way when they speak directly to you on the phone and if you continue bothering them it would be called telephone harassment now if you didn't mean to cause telephone harassment meaning like whatever I shouldn't done to them as a Nike employees team of Nike head quarters of Beaverton Oregon how many in the world would say that I deserve grace and forgiveness and to be possibility be reconsidered by to Nike locations with a fresh start of 2020 in there time frame to consider me once again for employment and for shopping on Nike.com and even to there stores as a suggestion and idea should Nike ever prosue of contacting the Police to anyone in the world ever again even I was told that the police some how doesn't like Nike or even anyone meaning to call the police for any reason even to be causing disturbance . I feel 100% offended to what Nike did wrong to me and because they are a powerful company they sure enjoy bothering the police on there end . I as a American disability do forgive Nike for what they shouldn't done by calling the police on there end and because the congressmen of the laws are fed up with Nike company in the world even how Nike shouldn't never reached out to the police in 2016 and even other times on me or to anyone . See My experience is the store manager name Danny from Eugene Nike retail store was a bit rude and cranky to me in 2018 for when I was okay to be considered back to Nike locations and of me being truly sorry for my mistakes . My hope is hoping Nike excepts my sorry for whatever I shouldn't done to them from the beginning to the past of 2016 and 2017 and 2019. Plus I am a Team USA fan council that is truly offended and even emotional . I would like to be considered back to Nike locations with Nike making an aprovable on there end and considered it for me to be allowed to do whatever is okay to do or not okay to do so if I get a fresh start to be allowed back to there locations in the world even in the USA I agree to follow there rules and would like there management to agree to leave the police alone and for them all and there staff on Nike,com and there retail people all thee above even on Headquarters staff HR people to agree to choose kindness at all times . President Trump and the congressmen of the law would like anyone that is a tax payer to agree to choose kindness for a life time and not to greedy with money and self-fish and mean to anyone on the phone even in customer service and for anyone to abide the rules of the law and to be nice to people with special needs even with special needs please call me anyone to aprove of this of me being truly sorry to Nike employees and there management team and for them to consider back to there locations and even all thee above and that I agree to no longer for a life time not to cause no more for the future to present for telephone harassment etc . 541-3599471. I would love to be a Nike fan council for Nike products to all nations .Steven Roy Barone 31 years old . plus my adopted parents are fed with Nike and even the police . I feel like Nike needs to lay off on the police on anyone world wide of all nations and maybe have everyone world wide except not to be causing telephone harassment all thee above . Plus I am offended how Nike when they allowed me back from the past there people were rude at there retail stores even on Nike .com for customer service people of Nike . I am very concerned of why Nike employees and there chairman and there former chairman doesn't know how there people at Nike is mistreating anyone with special needs even with out special needs seems like ever since Phil Knight the Nike co-founder stepped down as the chairman and is now part of board of directors to Nike company of headquarters should look and see why Danny the store manager from Nike retail store felt like being a bit rude to me then getting me into trouble because I shouldn't be reaching out to his store from the beginning to the past do I owe Nike employees a huge sorry for my mistakes ya I do and I except there forgiveness can I to present and to a life time when they ask me to stop reaching to them a lot on chat even on the phone can I abide there rules if I get invited back to there locations yes I can  hoping they allow me back to there locations this year of 2020. My handicap is learning disability Asperger's slight handicap .  So I realize I was truly mistaken from my past from whatever I shouldn't done to Nike employees of of bothering them and by asking them a lot of questions and by them providing me reasonable accommodations if when I do apply for jobs I agree not to be calling but waiting paitently for them to only call me or to anyone they decide to call  and I agree with the terms 100%.",well felt like nike world head quarters said continued telephone harassing going beaverton police detectives name dale partner name john drive eugene oregon told receptionist past beginning said want phone talking rudely saying kind help accommdations need employment security team hr people headquarters said steven call get offered interview job provide reasonable accommodations job tasks even could provide one staff work learn job inside retail store accendlty asking create job called cashier assistance helping cashiers helping putting peoples things inside nike bag could go faster cashiers waste time whatever got told headquarters nikecom management team hr dont job steven barone american disability even letting know got meet cofounder name phil knight person giving friendly hand shake friendly warm hug plus phil knight sent thank letter saying thank steven biggest fan nike urged apply jobs nike bizcom got chew badly poorly nike employees locations world even usa company dont like bothered reason well get lot applications people world applying nike jobs nike team get lot phone calls plus anyone world call nike nike would say end need nice way speak directly phone continue bothering would called telephone harassment didnt mean cause telephone harassment meaning like whatever shouldnt done nike employees team nike head quarters beaverton oregon many world would say deserve grace forgiveness possibility reconsidered nike locations fresh start time frame consider employment shopping nikecom even stores suggestion idea nike ever prosue contacting police anyone world ever even told police doesnt like nike even anyone meaning call police reason even causing disturbance feel offended nike wrong powerful company sure enjoy bothering police end american disability forgive nike shouldnt done calling police end congressmen laws fed nike company world even nike shouldnt never reached police even times anyone see experience store manager name danny eugene nike retail store bit rude cranky okay considered back nike locations truly sorry mistakes hope hoping nike excepts sorry whatever shouldnt done beginning past plus team usa fan council truly offended even emotional would like considered back nike locations nike making aprovable end considered allowed whatever okay okay get fresh start allowed back locations world even usa agree follow rules would like management agree leave police alone staff nikecom retail people thee even headquarters staff hr people agree choose kindness times president trump congressmen law would like anyone tax payer agree choose kindness life time greedy money selffish mean anyone phone even customer service anyone abide rules law nice people special needs even special needs please call anyone aprove truly sorry nike employees management team consider back locations even thee agree longer life time cause future present telephone harassment etc would love nike fan council nike products nations steven roy barone years old plus adopted parents fed nike even police feel like nike needs lay police anyone world wide nations maybe everyone world wide except causing telephone harassment thee plus offended nike allowed back past people rude retail stores even nike com customer service people nike concerned nike employees chairman former chairman doesnt know people nike mistreating anyone special needs even special needs seems like ever since phil knight nike cofounder stepped chairman part board directors nike company headquarters look see danny store manager nike retail store felt like bit rude getting trouble shouldnt reaching store beginning past owe nike employees huge sorry mistakes ya except forgiveness present life time ask stop reaching lot chat even phone abide rules get invited back locations yes hoping allow back locations year handicap learning disability aspergers slight handicap realize truly mistaken past whatever shouldnt done nike employees bothering asking lot questions providing reasonable accommodations apply jobs agree calling waiting paitently call anyone decide call agree terms,0.9979,positive

"Nike.com is the most reliable website to shop on for athletes, coaches, and people who like wearing comfortable sports wear.

Also I have shopped on Macy’s to get some sports wear and their was a max amount of money I had to spend on items in order to get free shipping and I barely wanted to pay for what I had in my shopping cart. In comparison, Nike.com has free shipping for members and their shipping is two days to no more than a weeks’ wait. With all of the other websites I have shopped on like Macy’s, Sporting Goods, Footlocker, and Eastbay: when I finally signed up for Nike.com and shopped, I realized I found that I found my perfect match. I have always been the type of kid who sees something she likes and go buy it whenever I get the money so even when I came up with just $20 I’d go on Nike.com to buy me a T-shirt which I couldn’t do on Macy’s with their max spending rule.

"I’ve spent a lot of money through Nike.com and they’ve never let me down so far. I’ve bought mostly footwear but also clothing and some accessories.Dispatch and delivery is quick and the courier company is one of the best as they give you a 1 hour time slot so you can run errands and make it back in time to receive the delivery.Every single thing I’ve received has always been packaged well and nothing has been damaged in transit.On the rare occasion I’ve had an issue it was with their hypercool baselayer tights that had the Nike Swoosh peel off on two separate items through no fault of my own. I spoke to a lovey guy through the online chat and explained my issue. He seemed to actually care, was very professional and personable and arranged for me to send the items back with the returns pack he sent to me and refunded me for the items plus something extra for my troubles. I just wanted a pair of tights that didn’t have the swoosh peel off but this was honestly the next best conclusion. I loved that by sending the tights back Nike’s relevant department could see what the issue was and resolve it for future products.Their app is extremely easy to use and I love their easy returns and great 30 days change of mind policy. It takes the stress and worry from buying online.

Now what bothered me was that he was having a conversation with her like that in a area where customers are and how he was talking to her. As I was listening i got bothered when He told her he felt if she didn't get the position she may go off or punch him (why would he say that) and asked her what would she do if she didn't get it her response was genuine she told him she would go for something else that she was bothered not because of that but because she kept getting put off, mind you I'm still in the fitting room then he goes on to tell her that he doesn't have to open a position and he is getting Irritated. Then he further goes on to  tell her how he fought for her to stay and other managers will see she is mad. She again told him she was not mad she was frustrated because she kept getting different answers. I was I'm disbelief he basically told her her job and a future position was in his hands. I waited until I no longer heard him,so I came on out and fighting back tears in her eyes she still asked me how did that fit and if I needed anything. I was extremely upset for her and I said no I'm ok and she told me to have a Happy Holiday. I came home and this was still on my heart so I thought you should know.

"Unfortunately this review agrees with Thomas. I have had exactly the same problems as he has. Made an order with standard delivery between 2-4 business days on Monday. However it took them a good five days to ready my product for dispatch! This was on my week off from work and was hoping for fast (in the 2-4 estimated time) delivery. However I was disappointed not to here from them until Friday. Which meant I would be back at work and unable to receive delivery. The products I received I was very pleased with! Seems like Nike have become lazy, taking a very long time to process my order for dispatch. Even more annoying when ou have to pay for P&P! Other websites offer free delivery which often comes next day when ordered early, makes Nike performance look very weak! Shame.",unfortunately review agrees thomas exactly problems made order standard delivery business days monday however took good five days ready product dispatch week work hoping fast estimated time delivery however disappointed friday meant would back work unable receive delivery products received pleased seems like nike become lazy taking long time process order dispatch even annoying ou pay pp websites offer free delivery often comes next day ordered early makes nike performance look weak shame,-0.2732,negative
"Earlier I have placed serveral orders from the nikestore.dk website, and In overall been quite satisfied on the service recieved. But lately I have had a couple of annoying experiences in placing orders from this website. If I ""fall in love"" with any of the goods on the website and want to buy these, I often choose from the possibility to recieve the goods Expedited with UPS, which has a stated timeframe to Denmark on 1-3 days. The only problem is, very often is has not even been shipped from the store within this timeframe. The last 2 times I have placed orders from this website I first recieved the orders 5-6 days after my order was placed. And it is quite annoying to pay 70 DKK for an express service you do not receive anyway. Last time I naturally claimed this fact at customer service and the representative made a cash back for me :0. Latest I placed an order last tuesday and this order has not arrived yet. I really look forward to see, when it arrives. My only recommendation for Nike is to cancel the ""expedited service"", when you are not able to deliver this service - You create falsch expectations !.",earlier placed serveral orders nikestoredk website overall quite satisfied service recieved lately couple annoying experiences placing orders website fall love goods website want buy often choose possibility recieve goods expedited ups stated timeframe denmark days problem often even shipped store within timeframe last times placed orders website first recieved orders days order placed quite annoying pay dkk express service receive anyway last time naturally claimed fact customer service representative made cash back latest placed order last tuesday order arrived yet really look forward see arrives recommendation nike cancel expedited service able deliver service create falsch expectations,-0.022,negative
