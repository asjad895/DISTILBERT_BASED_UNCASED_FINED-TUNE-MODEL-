Good comfort.. Good Quality... but i doubt Weather its fabricated by Nike or by Flip kart.....................................................................
So I thought of buying this new shoe (supposedly new shoe) and I guess flipkart claims too that they sell 100% genuine and new products but the condition of the shoe which I have got is pathetic !!It doesn't even look like an original NIKE Shoe and the finishing of the shoe is disgusting!!It has glue all over the sole and near the lace the make of the shoe is so so bad that the foam is visible.Highly disappointed and dissatisfied !!
"This is a really good product by Nike. Very comfortable to wear and they look good too...I've felt that they give complete support to your feet which makes them excellent for running purposes, but one can use them for casual wear as well. Judging by the price, the are really economical. I've always been in search of shoes that are comfortable, cheap and look good. this product has all these qualities and I recommend it for other users. i can't say anything about the durability right now bu..."
"This is a very comfortable shoe to wear,which is made up of good quality and it is very light weight & its really attracts people specially for the blue in colour"
"Pleae dont buy, neither looks like a Nike shoes . Flipkart dont sell these sub standard products. People look for quality products not just cheap products."
Quality not upto the mark for Nike Brand...I think it's a Factory Outlet product ( rejected)...So I will not suggest anyone to buy these shoes
"Very Comfortable to walk or jog in. Perfect Grip. Good Worksmanhip and material. Prompt Delivery. Haapy to endorse,"
"Satisfied with the product quality.Right fit, Great color combination.Happy with Flipkart's Super Fast delivery."
Great Running Shoe - Nike quality !I was extremely impressed with the quick delivery of this product.
"These shoes are very comfortable, fits perfectly and they look stylist, especially the TM NIKE logo look really cool. The quality is commendable.They very great for runners, I been using them for running, its feels great and it protects and cushions the feet perfectly."
Thanks to flipkart once again for providing good product at faster delivery.I bought this show and it is same as shown in the picture. Good fit and nice look.I wear this for ZYM and for Party. I feel comfortable when I'm on treadmill.
Excellent shoes ....I have used them for 4 years now...they fit really well and are super cool for running ...and look very stylish
Trusted .

"Good shoes, almost after 3 years of using this product I m writing this review"
Awesome product
These shoes are comfortable and are good for any sports activity and even daily use. Today its been more than 3 years and I still use them for playing basketball and for travelling too.
Flipkart really give me awesome goods . I am using this shoe since june 2014 . I always used this shoe for running purpose.  I ran daily approx 6 km with this shoe .
It was fantastic shoes
Nice shoes you should try it
Best Shoes....fitting is perfect...very perfect for Non Official purposes...Good One...
Nice shoes. I am loving it. Comfortable and looks great on any jeans.
"Good product, got it at a good price of 1436 completely worth it"
"Delivery was before time.Although I ordered a bigger size than my usual ones (10 instead of 9), it almost fits my feet.Had I ordered a 9, I doubt, it would have been that fit."
"The size is perfect and the shoes are good quality. I wore them and they felt really comfortable and provided support to the entire foot as opposed to only the ankle and the front toe area, this is because the shoe sole is actually raised from the middle. This is a nice feature. Would recommend buying it. Cutting one star because I think the material that in front of the shoe can get torn off but again I may be wrong and I will update this review after six months to see if they last that long..."
"i bought this shoes because i got discount on this product.shoe looks very good from outside but inside lining of shoes is very bad.i exchanged the shoes once because it didnt fit my feet,the shoes i exchanged was even worse inside material of that shoes came out"
Good product. good quality. low price. i am satisfied very much buying this product. i recommended to purchase this Nike Eliminate li Running and Walking Shoes. Thank you
I like the product . Shoes are quite comfortable and gives decent look.The blue color looks great and quite attractive . Being product of NIKE company the sole is firm . I like the product . The flipkart service was satisfactory . I got the product within 3-5 working days.Overall I will give these shoes 7.5 out of 10 .
very nice .........................good for running ...................in look it is stylish ..........................over all 5 star .............
the item is very good and comfortable too. the delivered item is as it is displayed in the cart. the prices is reasonable. It is worth buying...
Let me postulate the product facts - 1) Super Comfortable shoes.2) Awesome grip.3) Style 10/10.4) Fitting 10/10.5) Size availability 9/10. (This is an important factor for me 'cause I wear UK12).6) Delivery was before time. (As always. That's why I love Flipkart).So guys.. Buy'em eyes closed..!!
I ordered the blue grey colour shoe... And they shipped me the grey colour shoe...very disappointing.
They couldn't deliver the product. and when i tried to book it again the price was increased by 400 rs. really unexpected from Flipkart
good experiance...............................................................................................
"HI Team , Its Bharath HS , recently I purchase Nike running shoes from you.First of all am surprised that with in 18-20 hrs shoes was delivered to me .When I open the packing cover am very disappointed with the broken box where the shoes was packed .I think may be shoes was damaged or not genuine ..., but the shoes was really amazing .even the box has some damages there is no damage at all to shoes. The shoes was as good as new one.Now am using the shoes for couple of days ,its really goo..."
"I ordered a different Nike shoe with Black and blue color and when it was delivered it was damaged one it had problem with inner sole. So i thought of reordering the product but it was not available for 10 number size so i ordered a different one with green color, it's good but not satisfactory to me, so not a good experience.."
when available notification me...............................................................////////////////////////
"Please intimate me once this product is available in Size 10. i need this pair of shoes and from last 1 month i am tracking this shoe in (white, blue and black) colour. please intimate my email id is anshu85@gmail.com"
"Hello,I had returned a product and it has been more than 4 Months and I still have not received my refund, even after repeated reminders. Did not expect this from a company like NIKE. Details are given below. I have been writing to u guys for the last 4 months, but no one is bothered to solve this issue."
"Miserable time actually trying to receive my order. Nike have decided making a quick buck is more important to them than good customer experience. Please Nike, stop using Evri and use a proper delivery service."
"Shocking customer service - I cannot believe the lies, fob offs, calls hung up from this huge company ! Totally shocked to read so many poor reviews. How can they get away with treating customers so poorly. Awful to deal with - lies about refunds, no calls back - I’ve called weekly now for over 12 weeks ! Something needs to be done about this."
"Stop using UPS in Sweden. They never try to deliver the parcel to your home. Everytime they claim your wasn’t home so they delivered to the pick-up point instead. Since the introduction of home office, I’ve seen through that lie. That together with useless support from Nike customer servers sets the grade."
"Nike do not check their emails, i was sent a survey regarding Jordan 1's that i bought, decided to answer the survey and emailed them about the sizing problem i had not been given a reply back ever since, terrible expirience!"
"Nike does not care about helping you out of a scam. I was told I was out of luck because even though I had the $500 card canceled immediately after purchase, they said a purchase was made. They did not track down the person who supposedly bought something. They were also unable to reissue me a new card. Think twice before giving them your business."
"Ordered an expensive custom design boot. They falsely advertise in pictures a black shoe lace on the boot and when delivered it was navy. I raised with them and they give you the same speech as most call centers, a total run around instead of fixing and replacing. They then use blaming of computers and quality of picture as their excuse so be careful to order and check that you get what you understand in their descriptions rather than thinking the pictures they advertise is what you will get."
"Not sure how they illegally operate their website.Website is having hiccups.No cancellation remark about their 30 minutes cancellation window unless you try to search for it, which is not clear and not any merchandise standards.Chat and phonecalls are of no help."
"I have a metcon that is super new, but it is peeling off in the front and back. This shoe gets only 3 years , it was expensive, as are all Nike shoes. They said they can only do something when shoes is 02 years old."
"So the scammers who ripped my brother off earlier bought their stuff at online at Nike and Nike won’t stop the order, everyone else they ordered stuff off said ‘not a problem’ and cancelled their orders, Nike however said after 12 calls and 4hrs of stress ‘that’s not our policy’ and refused to do anything, screw you Nike!"
"I had to return shoes and the lady checked my states and returned my shoes and  she asked me do I want to write a review, I said okay then she said  let me scan on your phone, I gave her my phone then she scanned it and she started review without my notification and gave to me the phone,  that was unfair and uncritical"
Trust company with all kind of styles of snickers to many sports. For me is my favorite brand of shoes. Special in all retro styles have now.
Effectively Nike use a call centre to process there complaints and returns and they are just given a Script and probably have nothing to do with Nike itself. I purchased a pair of trainers that fell apart after first use so I contacted them via chat as that is all you can do I was then told I could return them as they were faulty. I was sent a prepaid Royal Mail return label and sent it I then waited 5 days checked the tracking and it said it was delivered they then contacted me and said I sent an empty box which is a complete lie as I have the weight on the receipt which I sent to them and they didn’t respond I then contacted them again and they said there’s nothing they can do and won’t send a refund. So effectively they now have my trainers I sent they have refused me a refund and have called my a lier. I contacted my bank and they said it’s something they can do and are issuing a charge back on my transaction. I recommend doing this if you want your money back I hope this helps. Also it’s pretty easy to report them to trading standard too.
"I received an email saying my order was delivered, but I did not receive it.When checking the delivery image that DPD sent through, it shows an image of a package in the drivers hand in the street. I went to nike.com to get an update/information on my package, but was unable to find an email address to rectify this issue.I'd be most grateful if someone would respond to me with an update on the whereabouts of my package ASAP."
"Exactly the same experience as many others, Product ordered not arrived “lost in transit” when I reached out, no proactive approach from Nike. I went back they tried a refund which is not what I wanted, I was promised a new item would be sent. I then received confirmation of delivery… still no item. Still no proactive measures from Nike. Reach out again. They are happy to refund me… this is the absolute minimum this company could do without literally stealing my money they had for 2 months. Won’t be buying again, app deleted bring on the disrupters!"
"Returned faulty shoes in November. I was told on 5th January that they had been inspected and a egift card would be issued within 7 days. We are now 21 days later and customer service keep fobbing me off.  Can’t make a complaint, can’t email anyone. The online chat people keep ending the chat. Poor service"
"I placed an order and am waiting to receive it. In two days I want to order more and find out that my account is blocked!Communication with the support service did not solve anything. They say my account is blocked for security reasons.What security. I am a registered customer, I want to make and pay for my order and I can't!This is the worst service ever!"
contacted them through their CHAT very quick and they change my shoes directly was very happy
I already submitted a review about Nike and I would like to mention that I have used their chat service a few times but they always say we are sorry that you are unable to access the app membership site and we will look into it but they never do. Why do they always put high top trainers on the membership only site it is unfair especially when it is so difficult to get air force or Jordan high tops anywhere else and some of those other sites are dodgy. They are Just going to lose out on sales if they don't sort this out.If I had wanted low trainers I would have bought low trainers but I don't
"I would rate this company a zero if I could. I purchased a Nike tech fleece jacket from JD , instead of going to JD I went to NIKE (big mistake of mine) and opened a dispute in October 2022. However, NIKE said they spoke to JD and admitted over the phone it was a faulty batch they had sent to JD. They requested I send the jacket back, which I did in exchange for e-giftcard. It’s been nearly 5 months , no refund or e-giftcard. Nike customer service have been fobbing me off. They stole the jacket off us and won’t even return it back to us. EXTREMELY POOR customer service. Worst company. Considering it’s so big you would expect better service. DO NOT OPEN DISPUTES WITH NIKE. They steal your item and won’t compensate you with the refund. No idea how to contact someone and complain either. Very very frustrating and poor."
I have been using Nike for very long time. I used to buy from shops but now I use online services. It’s user friendly and extremely efficient. Purchase Return and other options are available and as a customer my love for the brand is getting higher and higher every time I use Nike
"Not happy, received my order with the bag ripped open. And the product inside not even in a plastic bag for extra protection. These paper bags needs to be changed because you have couriers like evri that don't take care of packages and it gets ripped open. The courier had to ask at the door if there is supposed to be one thing in the bag because it was fully open. Change your bags."
"my Air Max which I bought for leisure time got a hole in the outsole in less than 3 months. However, I am happy with their Kyrie Irving basketball shoes and basketball shorts which are very light."
"Happy with their sport shoes, they walk pretty well and with much comfort"
"Have purchased custom trainers from the Nike website in the past, and was really happy with them and the service provided. I have tried logging in to do the same again, but I am being told I do not have an account, which is confusing. I re-registered and spent a while designing my custom trainers. However I have been trying to add these trainers into the basket to purchase for 3 days now with no joy whatsoever. I even tried adding a random item into the basket just to see if there was an issue just with the custom items but still not successful. I have messaged Nike but not yet had a response. Unfortunately I have decided to purchase from a different brand."
I ordered a custom set of Nikes. They honestly took some time to get here but im very stoked with the end result. ive never seen a pair of air max 97s this 🔥. my go to sneaker plug
Excelent site and great customer service.The site is very easy to navigate and the returns are smooth.
"Ordered a pair of trainers which weren't suitable, I returned however there was an issue on the courier side. Customer service were very swift to resolve. Also, delivery & quality were all great. Two new pairs ordered. Adding thanks to Lyle on Live chat today."
I bought Nike Air Max 97 from Nike one month ago and I wear them at work and I wear them all day long. They're so comfortable.5 star & 100% recommend
"Row from Highpoint Shopping Centre, Nike store. I would like to acknowledge the fantastic customer service that I received from him. He is very friendly and makes the customers feel welcome. He seems to have a great attitude towards helping customers and overall, does his job very well."
I just wanted to say that I highly rate Nike's customer service after having purchased a pair of running shoes for myself and my children. The shoes all turned up very quickly and I needed to return one of the pairs and was very pleasantly surprised to know that Nike accept online exchanges which a lot of places don't now. This was dealt with really quickly and easily with their online chat service and I am just awaiting the new pair! I think customer service has been the best I've had in a while compared to the sub par of lots of other companies when you purchase from them online.
I like my shoes they came on time 100% great experience and service would buy again
I tried to order the union Cortez collaboration through the SNKRS app and could not order them. I had to call Nikes customer support. A gentleman named Jon helped me figure the problem out and order the shoes I can’t wait to get in hand. And thank you Jon you helped me so much!
"Don’t know why loads are crying tbh, easy to order and I get the order way before expected ordered 170 pound shoes box was perfect shoes were perfect,quick and easy."
"This has got to be the WORST WEBSITE EVER.No matter how many devices, browsers or cards I try, I cannot check out, and when I called them they just say keep trying, get the App, try at home, try at work...well, WHY SHOULD I??? I think two hours spent trying to buy trainers is enough - if they can't be bothered actually fixing the problem then ADIDAS here we come..."
"Customised my airforce 1 trainers, very easy to do, told they would take around 6 weeks, seemed reasonable,  Informed all the time, and you could track the delivery. Mine arrived in only two weeks ( from Vietnam) fantastic,  thanks to all concerned. Happy  customer,  already planning for another pair. Thanks brendan"
"Great customer experience as a Nike member.  Recently purchased golf shoes but after a few weeks one of the cleats had a tear, even though worn and thrown the box away it was not an issue and I had a full refund.  Have now purchased their spineless golf shoes for the summer.  Membership also gave me free returns.  First class service so far from my many purchases."
"I had a very good experience with nike.com, i.e. it was the same identical product as in the pictures, the same selected size and they were transported very quickly and concretely identifying the location where the package is.  Nike.com Congratulations!"
I was shopping today at Nike in Gunwhalf  Portsmouth and had great service and helped by a polite young man called Lee
"Have been a passive Nike customer for years, but had my first complaint with them recently which they resolved within 10 minutes online.Have always been pleased with the quality of their products, and now that I know their customer service is top notch I'll continue to buy from them."
I recently bought a pair of Nike vapour max for my son in black and he’s happy with his pair. Although the pair came a little late.
I ordered a pair of new shoes and they are great comfortable stylish and the delivery was fast too it said it would come on Friday 28th October but it came instead on Monday 24th which is great
Their running clothing and shoes are the best out there. The Nike Alphafly Next% have given me some great run sessions and made sure I ran a 7 minute half marathon PB of 69:59! Always have fast delivery. The only time I’ve had an issue with something I’ve ordered wasn’t even their fault and they sorted it out for me.
I have a pair of epic luxe leggings that I ordered in November. I thought they were ok but this is a warning to others that the fabric is not like the other epic luxe leggings. The stretch and return is not as good and the leggings don’t move with you in the same way as old design/ fabrics. I have 5 old pairs! Crutch moves down and the comfort is not good
Free shipping on all orders sets them apart from Adidas and the speed of delivery is also much quicker.There are usually good student deals going so I order relatively frequently.Returns are very quick and handy. Refund is generally back in your account within 2-3 days and I have never had any issues with it.
"Bought a pair of Air Force One as a birthday gift; unfortunately they were faulty so had to exchange them for another pair. However, customer service was friendly, quick to respond, and the shipments (to Sweden) went very smooth. Really happy with the new pair. Will be buying from Nike again in the future! Gold star to the wonderful Kelly in customer service, that woman deserves a raise 🌟"
"Nike is not my go to running shoe but when i recieved a pair of Nike zoom runners as a gift i decided to use them as my work shoes. My 1st day wearing them i noticed they are super squeeky. It sounds like i am at a basketball game all day long. I do like the shoe. After i put my ortotics in, they are super comfortable but i absolutely hate the sqeeking all the time. I dislike it so much that i will probably not be sporting Nike kicks after these shoes. They look good and feel good which is important but the sqeeking will stop me from purchasing them ever."
Just joined Trustpilot but thought I’d write a few reviews for places I’ve been. although I really like my Nike trainers and find buying and returns on line fine. My disappointment using the SNKRS app is when using the raffle system & loosing (I’m not normally a bad looser) it’s very disappointing to see these trainers straight on E-bay at largely inflated prices.  Why not sell to people who want to use your product rather than someone after a quick profit.
"Ordered some Nike by you (air max 90's), delivery was fast, also returned a couple of pair of trainers which was super easy to do. Really happy thanks 😊."
"I have to say it’s really good experience to buy online and in store, the only problem is that i NEVER win a Ruffle on SNKRS e i can never buy anything like dunk o jordan mid on the website Nike.com or application, please fix this bot situation where after 0.01 sec everything is sold out. But still love it like i do for 6 years now, but need FIX NOW!!"
Arrived ahead of delivery date. Free postage through Nike Membership app. They used DPD for delivery!!
"Amazing experience from Nike! A website discount code would not work, so I sent Nike a tweet. They said if I put the order through on the website and send them the order number they would apply it to my order, and only deduct the discounted total from my bank. Having read all these negative trustpilot reviews I was rather dubious, but as the order was a birthday present, I went ahead and ordered. My bank account showed a pending amount without the discount, but when the amount was eventually taken from my bank, it was for the discounted total. So the discount was honoured. Delivery was also earlier then expected, so the trainers arrived well before the birthday!! I ordered on 23rd November, the birthday was on the 1st of December, trainers arrived on the 26th November! It would seem those who have a positive experience with Nike are not leaving reviews, hence all the negative reviews. So I have decided to leave an honest review to reassure buyers, it is not all bad. Nike Twitter team were true to their word, and my trainers that were a gift arrived in plenty of time."
"Top Class Customer Service - I bought a hat from Nike, with problems experienced with their Carrier UPS. UPS are an appalling carrier, please Nike stop using them! but Nike have been great and helped me so much, their customer services team are superb thanks for all your kind help. J"
"In need of sneakers or other sportswear, without a doubt, I go here. Nike is always stylish, comfortable and of high quality. Here you can find both classic models and extremely custom ones of a wide variety of colors and textures. In my wardrobe there are sneakers, pants, t-shirts, bags from this brand. Nike can be worn not only in the gym, but also in everyday life"
Favourite place to order from!! So much better than JD Sports. Haven’t got a single complaint. Everything I order arrives quickly and amazing quality. Can’t fault them in the slightest. Customer service team are also very helpful informing you on your parcels status and when it’ll be delivered etc. Ordered so many shoes and leggings from there.
"My first order from Nike online because it was the only site in the known universe with the trainers that I wanted. Online site very straightforward and simple: order, pay, fulfill, ship (the trainers were shipped from Belgium via the Netherlands), delivered, received exactly as ordered, very happy.Fulfillment/shipment/delivery were indeed impressive; 8 days from my online order to trainers on my feet. Excellent customer experience and wouldn't hesitate to order from Nike online in future."
"Would be 4 stars, but they would not honor the price of my local Nike store.I've asked management several times to order 12 wide where I live in some of their nicer shoes available, but they refuse to carry anything but the clunky Monarch :(  They always tell me to go online, but the price is nearly double what the local store has in the same model shoes!  Should be mandatory to carry the few other models that are available in wide!"
"Nike does it right with order, delivery, return and money back. Superrep was had too smelly materials. Invincible has non stinking materials and most comfortable to run in. I hope they try to make all products non smelling and add more payment options."
"I'm from The Netherlands and ordered shoes from nike.com and also did a return.Delivery was fast, ordered on saturday and arrived on monday. The shoes were too small, so I called them by phone (yes they actually have real humans to answer the phone) and we arranged to get me the right size. The person on the phone could see the current stocks which was also helpful. They emailed me a return label to return the shoes that were too small, used the box in which they came and brought it to the post office, and 3 days later I already had my money back on my bank account.To be honest I tried the shoes out a bit, but they said it was not a problem. I also expected the refund process to take some time, but when the refund was transferred almost immediately, I decided to write a short review here to express my appreciation.Would definitely buy again and there are no worries returning and getting your money back. I'm a very happy customer."
"Ordered a Christmas present (Football shirt) Thursday evening. Plenty of stock/sizes.Due to turn up Monday, came today (Saturday)at lunchtime. 48 hour turnaround. Super quick, very efficient and free delivery."
"I’ve just been assisted by Grace from the Nike customer service through chat and she was very helpful and friendly! I told her I’d give her a good review but there was no option to do that after we ended the chat so I’m posting here instead. Thank you, Grace, for being helpful, warm, and polite! I hope you have good days on the job and that you don’t get rude customers ❤️"
I have to give this 5 stars. Especially the airforce 1. On the 9th of June me and a friend climbed Ben Nevis in Scotland for young peoples mental health. I took my pair of white air forces that I brought from the Nike store. They got me to the top and back through snow wind rain and streams. Couldn't recommend a better choice of trainer. I think they should be moved to a new department called heavy duty footwear
"I recently purchased some trainers for both my husband and I as nike were having 30% off.  I ordered on the Wednesday and they were delivered by DPD on the Saturday (would've been Friday but I changed the date).  All in all it was a good, simple experience although looking at most of the reviews it's not been the same for everyone else. Guess I was just a lucky one?"
"Despite all these reviews i bought two pair of Nikes, with such awsome pricing, but i was worry for the delivery. I recieved my products much early in great condition with such good quality. Not only these purchase, i'm always happy with any purchases from Nike.Fill's brand online shopping is repofe, stay away from it."
"HOLY COW..... NORDSTROM LEVEL SERVICE AT NIKE.com!!!  My son is playing football and has football camp starting later this week.  We had to search everywhere to find a 14.5 football cleat.  We ordered a great one and it is a little too big!  UGH.... so I called Nike.com and met Darlene!  From the second she answered the call, she was a problem-solver and sweetheart!  She understood my stress at a football mama.  She found solutions for us and did it all with professionalism, kindness, compassion, and joy!  Where do we find that these days?  I will always order from Nike.com after this experience.  Thanks Darlene! You make Nike look great!"
Ordered 2 pairs of trainers came within 13days received messages on tracking and delivery very happy with trainers will definitely be ordering again
"cant understand the negative reviews on here, I have 100% perfect service from Nike, bought several items for my son and myself, over the past 2 years. Love the products and can't fault anything really, user friendly site, great offers, they will speak to you on the phone too, if you need them to. I am in the UK, very happy"
"Ordered a couple of pairs of shoes in the 50% sale.1st pair Christmas Eve, 2nd pair Christmas day.Both pairs arrived today, new years eve.Estimated delivery was 3 Jan so really pleased they came today.Tracked with DPD too so knew when they were coming.Thank you Nike 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
"I don't understand the reviews complaining about customer service. I have never had any problems with that, I recently returned a pair of football boots and the process was super easy and I didn't have to wait to speak to someone."
"Sneakers are very comfortable and relax your feet. Their sportswear not only looks great it feels great too. I absolutely love their hoodies!! If you are looking for quality shoes, cloths and sportswear Nike is the way to go."
Best Customer Service (AJ)I buy all my sneakers from Nike and I love all my collections. AJ from the Yorkdale shopping Centre (Nike) serves the best. I been there on several occasions and his service is a top notch. My partner talks so well of AJ too. Thank you Nike. Happy customer!
Been using nike for years. Latest purchase of red pandas came quickly and boxed well. I always appreciate companies who provide the returns label in the package.
"Ordered another pair of Tennis shoes, using discount code this time.As always, amazing service, goods shipped quickly, arrived perfectly..... as good as it gets.To add previous order size was too small for style of shoe, sent back, and very smooth refund.Perfect service, thank you"
"I don't have a problem with nike in general, but the shoes don't run true to fit when it comes to there shoes. I use to wear nike cortez back in 1990s, and I tried on a pair now and they just don't fit any more. So I had no choice but to get asics for now on."
"Firstly the whole 20 Ls and an instant EA..or so they claim, which wasn’t the case so false advertising. As for the whole back dooring situation and trying too prevent it. Why not continue with your tirade of bans but ban those who have early pair’s before release . They’re all on YouTube boasting about them, surely you have the power to enforce the sales n the date of sales to companies just like the movie n gaming industry who will not allow shipping or purchases before release and if the gamer does manage to get a copy early they can face a ban so why can’t you Nike just simply enforce the same power and penalise those who have early releases and ban them from SNKRS permanently which may prevent them from buying early pairs which may prevent back dooring or slow it down or simply make more shoes, they’ll sell out but supply n demand I suppose.. less shoes equals demand.. but isn’t that you creating the problem."
"Bought Air Force 1s last month and they look beautiful. and are very comfortable. However, the stitching on the right shoe is starting to come loose on the inside. I would have expected more for the price."
Always the “go-to” brand in my family whether it’s a purchase in store or online. Have never had any problems. Great selection of footwear to suit every need plus great style. You’ll always be looking fresh AF with a brand new pair of Nikes.
Excellent service from Nike refunded a pair of trainers immediately. Good customer care and satisfaction would use them again. It only took them 4 days on the item being posted back to them getting the trainers getting a immediate refund. Thankyou Nike
Have made multiple purchases via the website and have been happy with the service every time. Dispatch & delivery is quick and items are well packaged. Return labels are provided and this process is very efficient if required. Would recommend!
Great experience.  Free delivery and 25% off. Everything arrived on time and perfectly packaged.
"Shopping experience is fine, product arrived quickly, returns seem designed to frustrate. The only offer free returns if you set up a nike account, even when the return is due to their mistake. I chose the free return option of dropping it off at the Nike store because using their store finder for returns I saw there’s one near my office. On arrival, I’m told they can’t do the return because it’s a franchise store. So I’m back returning by Mail. We’ll see how that goes but not happy that I’ll lose the shipping charges on their mistake. Ans of course they don’t claim the business on trustpilot so they can ignore the complaints."
"Ordered couple pair of trainers in the sale, unfortunately one pair had marks on them, I didn't want to return I wanted an exchange, customer service were great, can't fault them and within a week i had a new pair, thanks"
I'm looking at the reviews and seeing bad ones but have to say I've only ever had good experiences with Nike from returns/refunds to receiving items. I'm in Ireland and never had an issue and will continue to use Nike.
I made a big order and most of it was too large.Returned it in my local post office but was taking a few days to hear anything back.Got in touch with Nikes customer support and they were very helpful.Garcia was their name.
"quality sale items, I managed to get myself some golf polos and some nike sb shoes.the app works great but I prefer the full website as i seem to click too many pictures while scrolling.2021 Nike stuff is really on trend"
"Reassuring service, and always use for my running shoe purchases ... items always arrive quickly and are easy to return for free if any issues. Special offers are competative vs. shops and 3rd party websites."
Bought some Nike pro leggings for my daughter for Christmas.Ordering to delivery went smoothly and the item itself is great.
"I really have nothing to bad to say about nike, their clothing and shoes are excellent in terms of quality. The only bad thing I can say is they are kinda pricey but other than that its well worth the cost."
Ordered shoes less than a week ago and they came today. Got a discount on website too which was great.Iv never had any issues with Nike. Returns are easy to do also and no hidden charges on arrival.Happy customer
Like always they are very good in branding but I think the quality of shoes got degraded lastly anyway I still like nike
"Placed lots of orders over the last year and alway get a fast, tracked, dispatch to Ireland. Had one faulty item and got very fast response and help from a human, not a bot. Find the sales to be pretty good."
Amazing service and access is really easyThey have very good customer service and always responsive to all my needs. No wonder they grow so fast
"The design of their recent collection is just so tame. Last collection they literally had fur in the shoe (air max), now it’s all Nike Air Force Pixar although well designed (not for real wear, as I’ve worn mine for two weeks in hospo and they have holes in), which is why I don’t think they are as fun and hard core as they were 2+ years ago. The colours are great but the wear is just so mediocre. I will always love Nike but hate how faddy they’ve become. I literally have all the knit airs in my hallway to remind me how much I loved them, and they all lasted two plus years of love. Now Nikes have no structure and make your legs ache. Such a shame as have always been an air girl. Nike come back with some kick ass airs for the house gals."
Good shoes all in all. Still have pairs from 6 years ago still in good condition. Looking forward to new ones!
It's legit... bought AF1's twice shipping from Netherlands 🇳🇱 arrived in South Africa🇿🇦. Aramex is the best also
"I love Nike clothes and shoes, and I often order for myself and my family. However, you have a big minus, SHIPPING. I really want you to fix this, and I could leave a 5 star review."
Along with the shoes Nike also provides high quality of sports and active wear. Very comfortable to wear and good fit. Not so happy with the shipping service. Otherwise good clothing.
Fast and prompt delivery after purchase. Kept updated via notification. Satisfied buyer
"Bought trainers 2 weeks ago, seen today that they were 40 pounds cheaper for Black Friday, I rang up and asked for the difference an they done it no fuss Very happy thanks"
Never had a problem with Nike service or products where bought directly thought them or thought a 3rd party retailer (eg JD Sports or Sports Direct)5 Stars for Nike
new trainers ordered and delivered really quickly. I ordered some Air Max 90's and they are perfect and fit really well. Easy website to use and delivered really quickly
"Best sports brand without compare. They’re loyal to anyone they do business with, honest and will never quit on you no matter what, even if others have. COYB."
I am amazed at the positive customer service experience I just had with Nike. I will be a customer for life. Thanks to AnnMarie for her amazing care and assistance!
"Great after service. Got a refund no problem for my puncutured air max 720's. I was way over the 60 day warranty, but hardly wore them due to lockdown. Thanks Nike!"
Always had a great experience with Nike. Had a return go missing and Francesca from customer services sorted out the refund straight away with minimal fuss.
"Decent quality shoes, maybe a bit overpriced though."
"I always have awesome customer service with Nike and when they run out of stock it isn't usually too ling before they get more, unlike most companies."
"I 100% recommend! Great product information, smooth purchase (took 4 days to receive shipment to Sweden) and very wide range of products and colors."
Dean Robertson was here
"Always had prompt customer service and quick delivery’s, had a few issues with the quality of clothes seem to damage/rip quick fast"
"The goggles that I bought are the best I have ever had. Easy to put on, adjust and the perfect fit so any water can not go inside."
"When a company is terrible I have left a scathing review but on this occasion I was really impressed so I thought it was only fair to leave a positive review. Very (nicely) surprised that it would come from such a large company as Nike. I ordered some trainers like I have done many times from Nike. They were realtively cheap and came with free delivery so already a winner, however, after a week of usage the trainers were not to the standard I would have hoped. As I had thrown away the box, the return slip and used them a few times I would assume that Nike would say a refund was not possible. I jumped on to the chat function was put through to a rep straight away, the dude replied immediately, told me 'he had my back' which was cool. He sent me a new return slip, told me it was cool to return in any box and that i would get a full refund. I have to say awesome service and how it should be for this sort of company. Kudos. Good customer relations - Just did it!"
Ordered my two sons shoes for school. Both great prices and received my order quickly. Love the free shipping
Made around 20 orders this year there my go to for trainers tracksuits etc never had a problem always delivered when they say and fast
I ordered Nike air forces and They came unscratched both the shoes and the box. They actually came a day before they were supposed to come
Nike by you air max 90 personalisee parfait commande 29/05 reçu le 14/06  plus rapide que je pensais merci a vous +++++
Fast shipping and a good service. Easy to use website Product came in 2 days and on a bank holiday weekend too. Can’t complain at all.
I really don't understand all the bad reviews. Nike have gone above and beyond for me on several occasions now.
"The Brooklyn 11 hoody and Airforce 1s bought for my teenager arrived today. He is still at school, so ofc I try on the hoody. I decide I want it. But I can't have it because it's his. I'm going to order another one right now. I'm joking. That'll have to wait until next week.Let me explain: The Brooklyn 11 hoody has a very distinctive cut around the neckline. It extenuates the shoulders neck and arms. It has enough body and shape that you can pair it with both tight and loose-fitting jeans. It's dope and I'm confident Kanye West would approve.I made a point to provide a review here because I read these reviews the day after my purchase, and on the strength of the dismal ratings fretted that I'd made a big mistake. I'm here to set the record straight. The parcel arrived on cue (14 days as promised). It may have arrived sooner if it hadn't got held up at NZ customs for a week! But two weeks from Europe or USA, for a clothing parcel? that's good. They provide an ETA based on your location so if you can't bear the thought of waiting 2-3 weeks then don't buy it. They give you a thirty-minute window from POS to cancel for full refund. Not bad!The customer service ""chat"" option is fast and efficient. They give you clear instructions on returns (which are free btw)."
"I bought a pair of shoes, they arrived in expected quality from Nike. I have no complaints with your service. Excellent!"
Your real friends are those who hold your hand in the storm. Nike will forever be goated for holding ours. KTBFFH.
Their product is of the best quality and very durable. They have one of the best delivery and customer services ever.
"Company is okay, just okay. I am not impressed. I get my delivery but it takes too long, you don’t hold your breath."
Best brand in the business - love my new training gear! Thanks for the quick delivery too!
Fast delivery and outstanding shopping experienceI highly recommend using Nike their delivery times were amazing
"Took a number of attempts but replacement trainers received free of charge, all good in the end"
AMAZING website.. Brilliant delivery time to UK.. 2 trainers order 2 days later deliver well packaged.
"Ordered three pairs of sliders, delivery was very prompt and the sliders are very comfy."
JR Helped throughout my entire process with my questions and help. Big Big applause. Thank you so Much!
Good experience with Nike.com. I'll purchase again.
Fast delivery great product very happy with this
"Viktor was so extremely helpful and polite. Great customer service, thank you Viktor and Nike!"
"Recently ordered some shoes that were on sale, they came quickly and fit really well. very happy."
Always order Air Force from Nike and they are delivered super quick. I’ve had no issues so far.
Great ordered a pair of air force ones from Nike by u and they came out fresh and very fast
Customer service is lovely. Thank you so much Ernie! Will definitely be ordering again ☺️
Make several orders in last 2 years and always no issue and delivered in 3 days with UPS.
I ordered an AJ from the website and it arrived properly and they also provided me a discount.
Best customer service they had. What ever issue u have. They are great at deal with that.
So far so good never had a problem with them. Deliveries or returns always went smooth.
"Brilliant, trainers arrived next day."
The highest quality shoes in the world! thank you for your work! You are a great company
The socks are very comfy and lasting.. goes really well with my white Nike trainers
"Nice brand, fast shipping! Thanks Nike :-)"
"The product is good, just fall in love with them!!"
Their policy and Black Friday sale are the best!I can return shoes anytime I want!
Ordered many times Nike shoes shipped free with UPS in 3 days ! All good as always.
"Got some great new trainers, would be 5 star rating if they weren't so expensive!"
"Very pleased with my order , always great quality garments with a fast delivery"
Stick by you when times get tough. They make rubbish Chelsea shirts though.
"successful fabric - cotton with polyester, cool, color, shape, seam quality"
My order was arrived in a timely manner. Everything is good so far.
"Fast delivery, exceeded delivery timescales and great pair of trainers."
I bought Nike gloves and I really like them I will def cop things again
i recommend high quality and worth the money most of the time
"I've jut received my new shoes from their website, very fast sending"
The website is great just wish they’d offer more delivery choices.
Bought a tracksuit set it’s a little small but love the material
Perfect as usual! Aj 1 low coral size 10.5 🔥
They are able to refund and return the item through a local store.
Excellent customer service at Long Beach Outlet store!Thanks
the shoes were black and i like black although i chose the colour
my order arrived in 3 days from day of order with UPS . all good
"All in order, package came in time and everything was right"
"👍🏽 Very good service, best out of all the big shoe companies."
"All in order, package came in time and everything was right"
Would definitely recommend over three and hyundai
Good site but slow shipping in comparison to adidas
"Best of the best, always buy their trainers :)"
"Good products, thank you"
Great sneakers but a little bit overpriced.
Great trailers purchased online and fast delivery
I like my new pair of shoes and it was affordable
Fantastic products they get it right every time
"Love my shoes, fast shipping and easy to order"
"I like Nike Shoes, best brand. Quality is good."
All arrived but a little lateHence the 4 star
I like the shoes very much.. Very high quality.
Lots to choose from got some good deals 👌
"Average shoes, high price"
Great brand! My family and I love Nike.
My favouite brand! Very good quality!
quick delivery. good quality
"very good site, no worries"
Maximum comforts.
"I made an order and had a little issue and also couple of other questions. I entered the Live Chat on nike.com and Ronald was servicing me. He was amazing, very polite, answered all my questions very quickly, resolved the issue, very nice. Amazing customer service, I am very happy and awaiting for my Air Force 1's 🤩🤩🤩"
"I ordered a product from Nike and timed it so that it would arrive prior to the hot weather week we were all expecting. I ensured that someone was home to accept the parcel but it never arrived! The Nike customer service was brilliant in explaining what happened to my order but it turns out that DPD just decided that I wasn't in and returned the item to Nike! This isn't the first time DPD has done this in our area as its quite rural. What a waste of time. I don't want a refund, I want what I ordered please! I gave 3 stars because DPD let Nike down here."
"Always very fast and on time, most bad reviews seem to be people shouting about nothing"
"Wow! Just wow!Fast delivery! What more could you want?I returned an item from my order today and Madhuri and Jamie from the customer care team on the Nike App were so helpful!Issued a refund straight away for the item I returned and mind you, it was my first time returning an item! It came up on my PayPal account as I paid through paypal. Hands down one of the best experiences of my online retail and would highly recommend to anyone to shop online at Nike!"
"Great discounts and sales across the site regularly, happy with my purchases and with the prices. I’ll be using Nike website a lot more than the shops."
Have ordered 10+ pairs of trainers as well as other items from Nike. Every time the delivery is quick and always left emails detailing when things will arrive. Surprised by all the negative reviews as my experience has been top notch
"I love this brand, one of the best"
"Always ordering direct from Nike, far better than the middle man companies, prices are the same, offer student discount and delivery is fast and free if you are a member!  Plus I have sent things back and refunded within days, really good service!"
"I have an incomplete spinal cord injury and I have difficulty completing tasks that rely on my hands. I was looking for sneakers I can put on independently. I like to go for a good long walk using my Rollator walker and I need a quality shoe. I also prefer to be more stylish so I’m not interested in the usual Velcro options offered for folks like me. Luckily, NIKE has the new Flyease line. I tried several sizes and models before finding a perfect fit in the Nike air zoom Pegasus 38 model. The Nike representatives were awesome in helping me figure out what would work and the return policy made it quick and easy, not to mention cost free, to try out different shoes. I also enjoy the dry fit line of clothing. It’s perfect for Arizona weather. Thank you NIKE for developing some more options for those of us who are unable to tie our shoes, and still  eager to be physically active."
I ordered the wrong item but Manuel could not have been more helpful and kind about it. Shopping at Nike.com is always such a pleasure the returns and exchange process is too easy with speedy delivery too can’t fault them!
"It is hard to find many things in stock, but when I do manage to order something it is usually pretty fast delivery. Free returns is also good."
Always great service. Impeccable products. Perfect.
"Not sure where all the hate for Nike is coming from. Ordered some Wild Horse 7’s on May 5th, arrived on May 8th which was some five days earlier than expected and everything was perfect. Brand new product in perfect packaging and shoes fitted as expected, half a size larger than my ASICS and they fit like a glove. Top job."
"I have ordered many times with Nike, and the service is stunning. They offered free returns, which is very convenient as I had to use this feature.Overall, their products have a wonderful design and they are very good quality."
First time ordering directly with Nike. Lots of delivery updates and parcel came well packaged and as expected.
I just want to thank Majid from the Taplow Branch who has been extremely helpful and kind throughout my shop. He has delivered the best customer service. Thank you once again.
"After seeing all the bad reviews i got scared my order would not be handled with respect, but that is not true. Bought 2 shoes, received them the next day, and returned one with no problems, I got refunded the next day. Good service!"
The best!! Nike service is incredible.  From sales and offers to produce and availability.The customer service and returns is on point as well.I’ve ordered lots from Nike and never had a bad experience.
Shauni from tallicutry nike factory was absolutely amazing really polite and fast 😊
So far so good I got 25% off any full price item even a £400 item would of been 300 birthday treat from nike the greedy company you are all talking about nike is top quality I had air max since I was walking
"Made an order for a tech fleece. Thing came super fast. However the top was missing, they refunded it instantly. Amazing service amazing products. Best customer service."
They provide me a discount because the package was delay. I am okay with that!
Bad service for this website!Delay packages!
"Great site, great products and great customer service. Always order from here and have no problems, item usually come 4 or 5 days early aswell.Great feature of free delivery if you’re a member too.5/5 stars."
"I have no idea where all the rubbish reviews are coming from although they all sound suspiciously the same. The website is brilliant, excellent sale price for my trainers. Goods dispatched as promised the day after ordering. Already have the tracking. If nothing now goes wrong it will have been one of the smoothest shopping experiences I have had outside of Amazon prime. If anything does go wrong I will update. I am just glad I ordered before I saw these shocking reviews. Are they for real???? I am within the UK.So, a few days later: Trainers arrive via DPD our best UK courier, full tracking provided and actually earlier than estimated, and the trainers are exactly as described and expected and even more comfortable/better quality than I could have hoped. Is my experience really such an exception to the bulk of genuine (?) reviews?"
I love nikeThe shoes are all very stylish and are also super comfortable.
Found a great sale online and was actually able to return an item that didn't fit.
I had an issue with an order I placed. No I didn’t get out come that I wanted but the customer service from Abbie was fantastic. Extremely polite and as helpful as she could be. I will be shopping with Nike again as I could not fault the agent.It’s hard this day to have a customer service agent that actually are polite and are will to listen.
Ordered trainers over the weekend. They arrived early and could also be tracked. Seamless delivery and will be using them again in future.
Ordered sneakers in Spain. Fast delivery.
Impressed with Nike ordered some leggings and they fit perfect and delivery was as stated!
Bought runners online but they were too small. Returned them free of charge and refund has been issued. All in all from ordering to refund took about 4 days. Delighted with the speed. Pity about the fitting.
I've been wearing Nike shoes all my life I'm really happy with all my purchases. Only thing that concerns me is that the price is a little bit expensive for the running shoes.
Got some air force 1's recently and love them. Quality is amazing and they look so fresh!
Purchase regularly from Nike.comMy most recent purchase was 5 pairs of Air Max for me and 1 pair as a gift. So that I did not have to wait on delivery they sent the items in 3 orders so i got them sooner.The pair that was a gift was too small which was unusual as a size ten usually always fit. I wanted to exchange but they did not have the same ones in Stock. I returned for refund which was done quickly no problem at all.Bonus 2 days after refund they were back in stock and 10.5 ordered.Will continue to order
Had no problems with the order items arrived as ordered. Maybe the sizing is a bit wrong on the website as my item arrived a bit too tight. But other than that good service.
"I have ordered Nike running shoes on their official website. I received no confirmation email whatsoever! I also tried to change the address because it was written that the shoes will arrive on March 23th and via dpd. And dpd just leaves packages with who ever is in the building. I though I have managed to change the address via chat (the woman was very nice), but I have seen that they delivered today and left it with my neighbor! Puma is much better!Update: I was angry when I wrote a review above. I mean who cares for the conf email if the shoes arrive two days later!  And shoes are great. The best ones so far. Very comfortable and light! I recooment them to everyone. Will buy more soon!"
I like the brand and it’s seems better to buy direct from the manufacturer
I am a regular customer on this site and delivery has always been timely. One recommendation would be to attempt to try on the runners/boots in a store prior to ordering (if the cost benefit exists to use the site as a result of discounts etc) as sizing over differing shoe types can lead to the shoe not always realising the perfect fit.
Ordered a pair of Air Force 1s Thursday and they arrived Sunday morning. Perfect in every way. If you want Nike stuff why go anywhere else!!!!
"by far the best experience I've had with customer service. I requested to return a pair of leggings that had some stitching loose and without an order number handy, I was able to return them with no problem at all and the person I spoke to was very helpful."
"amazingDelivery on time, never late to refund, what else I can have."
"My favourite company. I buy a lot of clothes from Nike because they last really well and look good after a lot of wear. Compelled to review after I recently got my first faulty item, fault occurred after return period. I spoke to an ACTUAL person on the end of the customer service chat who was so nice and had the issue resolved really quickly. Can’t wait till the shops reopen as Nike Outlet is superb for end of line and reduced stuff. Online shopping is so easy with free shipping and returns. Wish more companies would operate like this"
Great service with a very easy returns facility. Fast refunds.
So so impressed with Nikes online customer service today. Quick resolve on a return issue I faced today. Despite any of that the return policy and navigation options and chat service online is great!! Thank you Nike
Great experience arrived a day early always was informed by text of delivery time and wasn't disappointed was not a second late. Also where alot cheaper than anywhere else will be ordering again soon.
"My experience with Nike is brilliant. I have been shopping with them for almost a year and every time the service is great. Parcels arrive fast, free delivery for members, returns are so easy and refunded without fuss and they do have good sales and offers. Best shop I ever used."
"I’m a regular buyer from Nike but rarely recognise their ongoing commitment to delivering excellent service so here it it on the best forum I can think of.From price, options and customer care, Nike nail it every time. Thanks Nike!"
When they have their back to summer discount codes this is the place to be to get all your Nike shoes!
Outstanding customer service and exceptional products; the team are always on hand to help with product knowledge and are always happy to correct things if they’re not right!10/10
Thanks for great service! Would order again!
"Brilliant, ordered shoes on the 28th of feb and arrived 2nd March. Don’t understand all the complaints?"
Very pleased! Bought lots of  X Sonic  for my little sister for her birthday. very high quality and great condition.
"I purchased some running shoes from the Nike GB online shop. They were despatched and delivered very quickly. They ended up being too big for me so I had to return them. The returns process was the easiest and fastest I’ve ever experienced with any online shop ever. I took them to the post office on Thursday, and by Monday the return had been acknowledged and the refund had been submitted to my credit card. The returns process was so easy that it made me confident enough to try another pair of running shoes. The second pair were also delivered quickly and this time they fit perfectly and I love them. Thank you Nike"
Excellent products and helpful stuff have used many times. Live updates of delivery have called customer services to get sizing guide they was helpful.
Customer service are soo helpful. I purchased a pair of trainers with my 25% birthday discount a month ago and I decided I wanted to exchange the colour and it was so easy to do so. I told the customer service assistant and he processed the exchange for me straight away and sent me a return label to my email and the new shoes arrived 4 days later. Super quick and super helpful. Highly highly reccomend. I’ve purchased about 4 shoes over the past 6 months and every time has been such an easy experience.
"I have ordered many things from nike.com. I have been very pleased with the quality of all items apart from some Nikepro synthetic tracksuit trousers which have ripped around the heel.The custom shoes have been of very good quality. In addition, the delivery has usually been fast for all items (relative, obviously the custom shoes take much longer but both have arrived before the allotted date)Generally, I have been happy with the products. I would bear in mind that large companies often have positive and negative experiences for customers so please take my review with a pinch of salt"
"I'm really satisfied with quality that nike offers i am wearing mostly nike stuffs also i have to mention that i am very satisfied with the last product i bought W AF1 SHELL sneakers, very easy to wear i didn't expect i can walk for so long with this sneakers and not get tired. 👍"

item was what i expected but delivery was in time frame and customer service was poor.
"Excellent product, returns process is great (I always order two sizes). I recommend becoming a member as it makes ordering and returns super easy."
I bought one pair of air forces. Unfortunately they were defective so i had to return them. After one week i bought the same pair of shoes and they were defective again!! I returned them as well but they didn't return my money for this pair! Luckily the costumer servise was really nice and polite so they said they would take care of it... I'm still waiting for my money.
Don't get all the bad reviews. Bought about 5-6 items from them and all arrived early and were spot on 👍👍👍👍
Shoes got to me with no issues
"Customer service was really bad when i went through 6 collagues to chas3 up my order even worst when i went through another 5 to ask 3hy my order was cancalled ! But a lovely customer service agent called jo was lovely and super helpful a d actually listened, gave time and resolved my problem through chat ! Not all hope is lost xx"
Totally in love with my new trainers and super fast delivery 🙏
Never had an issue when ordering from Nike. Ordered some Air Force ones recently and they came within 2 days! So earlier then expected with No issues. Happy with purchase. Would order again!
Ordered via SNKRS app. Next day delivery. Always fast delivery at Nike. Free return. I can’t complain. Except that I want to win more raffles ;)
"Received a discounted pair of Tanjun traners yesterday, quick and free delivery. Have always found their service to be very good, will definitely shop here again."
"I wish Nike would claim this page because I’m shocked at the customer service problems people are having. I’ve NEVER had a problem with them and I buy a lot of runners from Nike. I’ve always held them in high regard. I would give 5 stars but after reading everyone’s reviews, I’ve come to the conclusion that, maybe one person could be wrong but not 20+ people! Shame on you Nike you have gone down in my estimations. Your customer service should be better than your products, not the other way round."
Always had good customer service only once it was bad and that was solved by the second call when I spoke to someone else.
My orders with Nike always go smoothly. I suggest you download the app as it gives you better updates
"Trainers which I personalized just came yesterday, ordered online. Looked same as I wanted and were able delivered on time with nice packaging, as I requested , thanks!!"
"I ordered some Nike by you Air Max 95s on the 20th December. At the checkout it told me it would take longer because they are custom made. It said I would get them on the 21st of January and I had no problem with that because they had to come from Vietnam to the UK. I actually got them today on the 7th of January so I am very happy. The trainers are perfect, exactly what I ordered and I'm definitely going to get more. Only downside is that Nike use UPS and their delivery tracker is horrible. Apart from that no bother at all."
"I had purchased a pair of shoes for my sister for Christmas. UPS said they delivered when we never received it. I spoke to Shawn, and he sent out another pair with expedited shipping.. no questions asked. Excellent customer service!"
"all ok, but the shipping is very very slowly"
Amazing shoes. I have never seen better shoes in my life before. I am not late to my office anymore! Thanks Flyzoid of these life-changing and innovative shoes!!
"I've been using nike.ie for about a year now, about 6 orders in total. Very easy ordering, good delivery tracking. Not always the same choice as in stores, but in general cheaper than stores. Very easy free returns at the post office. I just used the chat to speak to Reiv, as one of my returns wasn't processed. Turns out it was my fault as i used the incorrect returns label, but they sorted it out quickly and have processed the refund. No wait for the chat service,and Reiv was quick to get up to speed, cheerful and helpful. To me, the service seems seamless. Thank you nike, I will continue to use the website for my purchases."
"Good quality, fast delivery +++++"
"I’ve ordered 23 items, trainers, football boots, tracksuits,Socks everything comes. some arrived today Xmas eve to only ordered them at weekend.Brilliant service."
"I have nothing bad to say about Nike. Its free delivery, free returns. I had all the way positive experiance supported by lovely and helpfull team. At the end of it I got two pairs of great running shoes. Thanks Nike."
Happy runner! I bought my new Pegasus a few weeks ago and I really like running on them. Nike E-commerce always delivers on time!
"Fast devilery but the quality of my shoes were just aweful. This is not what I'm used to, I'd rather go to the store instead next time.."
Nike.ie is the best sports retailer online for deliveries. Some of my items arrived in 3 days which is super. Returns are simple also.The only thing I can fault them on is their online store doesn't stock a lot of the items found in their Dublin Store.
"Nike is one of my favorite places to get cute and trendy activewear, hoodies, and even shoes!"
"I have ordered multiple pairs of shoes over the past year from Nike, all items arrived quickly. I had to return one item with no issues. Found their returns process very straightforward. Love their easy to use app!"
Nike are normally brilliant. Free Delivery and returns and customer service generally is good.Only had one issue but solved in the end so will give them 10/10
"Nike you pulled this one out of the bag!!! Black Friday sale, missed the trainers I wanted, picked another pair & although the size was out of stock, I could go through & buy them so I chanced my arm, got a confirmation email & it said no money had been taken from my account as yet! 2 days ago I got notification that I had been charged by Nike...I was so hopeful & just now the most stunning pair of trainers have arrived at my door! They’re a gift & she will LOVE them...well done!! NIKE direct forever more! 🥰"
"Ordered two pairs of trainers on the 3rd, I received them today on the 5th! Very please thank you Nike very happy"
Personally I didn't have any bad experiences with Nike my shoes last a couple of years and clothes maybe less because I'm growing but ye no complaints at all for now.
"My order wasn't perfect, but when I got in touch with Nike customer service on the 'Live Chat' feature I was very pleasantly surprised. A representative named Ronaldo helped me by shipping the missing item from my order AND by walking me through the return/reorder process on the shoes which didn't fit well. In addition to this he made sure I got my discount on the reordered shoes.He was very patient and courteous. Probably best customer service I've ever experienced."
"After being ripped off and left extremely disappointed with JD Sports, I decided to shop using the Nike app. I have now ordered from them twice and had absolutely no problem, delivery and tracking is faultless and everything perfect with my order. Make sure you download the app when buying as I'm not sure if the website is the most reliable. I’m seeing loads of bad reviews here but am unsure why."
Ive found there store to be very good and delivery was okay. I love their clothes just need to upgrade their ordering process a bit more
"Excellent online retail experience.  Discounts were impressive, as was the refund process.  Highly recommended!"
brilliant! ordered a pair of jordans and arrived within two working days (4 days earlier than the expected date) great condition and received updates on where my parcel was and when it was dispatched. Was able to use my uni days and got money off which is also good. No complaints.
"Great online experience, updated regularly regarding order and delivery information. Smooth returns process."
"Shocked at all the bad reviews, I order all the time. I have never had a problem. I always expect that they have delays with shipping when they are running promotions like 30% off, which isn't a problem for me. I've returned trainers and refunds are always issued quick."
"Would be dreamy if all goods services were as fast and efficient as Nike. Ordered and received within two days - much faster than their advised delivery date, four days earlier in fact. Will definitely be ordering through their website in the future again given the issues I've had recently with other stores like Size and Foot Locker with undelivered items and exceptionally late orders. Big up Nike!"
"Surprised to see so many negative comments, my only thought is fake 🧐 Always happy ordering with Nike and always seem to be cheaper or have a discount code displayed on home page. If there is something in particular I want Nike.com is my first option to buy from if in stock"
"I'm super amazed at Nike plus, my stunning order arrived without any hassle.. Items are gorgeous... Just as in the pics... Service and delivery 🚚 excellent.. Can't wait to purchase again keep up the great service ❤️ love Nike clothing. Thanks saj south Africa"
Always had great service with purchases and returns hassle free and lots of discounts
"Website is super easy to use, always great discounts and free delivery, packages arrive within days and are really well packaged. Great company!"
Just had a wonderful experience bought trainers few months ago hardly wore them few times they were faulty decided to tell nike spoke to 2 lovely people flo and Ann who rectified problem for me iv been buying Nike 25plus years one bad product not to bad at all compared to other companies out there and they sorted it for me cracking customer service and normally great products will continue to buy easily
Everything perfect. Website simple to use. Items all packed and delivered immaculately. Only ever had to return 1 item and that was my fault and even that was simple. Excellent service
"The Nike Zoom victory 3’s are the best track spike out of the Nike brand. The spikes are lightweight so we can run as fast as we can, they are durable, they can take a good beating on the track, and they have great traction, it is great in the rain and even great in the grass, there will be no slipping with these spikes on.  I also won state in the spikes I had no complications, they were comfortable and I felt like I was gliding down the track to victory."
Pleased with thw service. My package was delivered in a couple of days. No any issues arised.
"Ordered footy socks for son, received within a few days and got discount too, very pleased"
"Ordered last week and nothing in the box, how do I contact them for a refund? Thanks James"
"I placed my order, only to read all these negative reviews afterwards. I really regretted my decision and contemplated cancelling. I then decided to hold off and give them a chance. I'm glad I did, as the stuff arrived today in an extremely timely manner, and my trainers and top are of the highest quality. Unless I am an anomaly (in a good way) I can't really understand all these negative reviews. I sadly felt obligated to come on and give them a positive review, or at the least show everyone that it is possible to get good results with Nike."
I ordered hoody and shorts arrived in 3days. They didnt fit so returned them.. refund was in my bank within 3days. For people moaning about delivery dates it does tell us before check out to have a look at the delivery date as some items may be delayed.
"Great place great shoes, came quickly"
They produce good equipment for the sport. But it is quite expensive.
Bots buy everything....
Nike has the highest quality footwear and apparel a runner can ask for. I have a lot of experience with my shoes and the customer service has been very good at finding the right size.
"I have bought from Nike.com many times and their Sevice is consistently flawless. Easy to deal with, easy to contact Customer Service, quick deliveries, top quality clothing. I highly recommend them.My only suggestion to Nike would be to offer discounts from time to time and loyalty rewards/discounts."
Would like to say how helpful Heather was on the customer services call today.  I put the input my email address incorrectly and did not get confirmation.  She found it and amended this.  She was very help and very courteous and deserves recognition.
Good service and quick delivery . Kept informed unlike those clowns at JD Sports who are a joke.
Great design So comfortable !
"eshop / Nike Canada is the Gold standard for any e commerce platform. I have purchased on line a variety of product multiple times and i have had no problems.Granted shipping is slow and sometimes order release is slow but we are living in Covid times and this should be forgiven.  Returns have been seamless, once my package is scanned at the post office i immediately get confirmation of my refund.I'm sorry for all the customer that have had a hard time i know its not pleasant."
Ordered pair of Nike 90 Safari on release Saturday morning. Arrived 2 days later on the Monday afternoon. Arrived double boxed - Everything in perfect condition. Kept me up to date on the progress of my parcel too. No complaints - Will use this site again.
Hi I’m ordering some Jordan’s for my son and read a lot of mixed reviews have people received there order??
"Ordered 2 pairs of Jordan Mid's, not heard from them in over a week, emailed customer services to find out they didn't have the stock for one of them, was contacted by Danica. She looked into my order and contacted me multiple times keeping me updated. Offered me a full refund and a discount on my next order due to it being so long.  Danica made my bad experience so much better! Was so polite, kept looking into my order for me and kept me updated the whole time.  Will still order from nike but just wanted to give this person a shout out.  Nicest customer service person I've ever spoken to!"
"Never had a problem with nike and delivery, always delivered on time and if I didn't want the product I sent back to get a refund and no problems"
Customer service were all really nice to me.Just wish Nike would take my money faster.
"""very happy with the fit and very happy to have the slippers like this..."" ""Best service given by Nike thank-you"""
Got most of my shoes from nike but sometimes the fit seems different
"I order 2 jeans online ,quality products highly recommended"
i ordered nike court vintage premium. came in 4 days.. amazing!!
Love it. Nike since day 1
"Ordered online (Monday bank holiday) for next day delivery. Thought they'd arrive on Wednesday but they actually arrived on Tuesday. Shoes are great (Metcon 6), breathable, sturdy and comfortable. The website was easy to navigate, easy to checkout."
Good customer service - helped me with my missing package and quickly offered me a refund! Thanks Nike
"Excellent service. Ordered numerous items in the 25% off sale. Love all the items but one of the printed logos was printed incorrectly. Very minor mistake but a mistake non the less. I rang Nike to make an exchange and the item was selling very quickly with only my size left. They reserved a pair for me as I was concerned by the time they received the item back it would be out of stock. Returned item on the Wednesday using their free Royal Mail returns. It arrived at Nike on Thursday and I had my replacement pair on Friday less than 48 hours later. Fantastic service, thank you."
"Ordered something Saturday due in a week, but came within three days. As good as this is, I don’t like that recently I’ve been getting no shipping details or any sort of updates on my orders. I thought it was my email but I’m getting no updates on my nike account either. As well as this I made two purchase which both got cancelled last week however I’m yet to receive a refund. Nike’s usually been good but recently it’s been unhelpful."
The Nike website is great. If you get the app it is even better. Works like a website should
"ordered from Nike 3 times in a last few months,very good experience!! on the first order - one of the items was too small (I chose the wrong size) - all the rest was perfect.I returned the item with the wrong size- received the money back for it in about a week.placed another order with the item right size+more things, and after a week placed one more order with more things.. last 2 orders arrived same time. All 3 orders arrived really quick!!Everything is perfect!! the customer service is great! I got the answer to my question in about an hour! I am realy satisfied from Nike's service.I am surprised from the bad reviews and experiences some people had... I hope to be always a happy customer as I was till now"
Great value and although deliveries were staggered the communication was very efficient. Would recommned especially when using the app offers.
"No complaints, surprised at the other reviews."
Ordered a Pegasus 36 and arrived 4 days before scheduled. Very fast delivery in Portugal
"Does it get better than Nike? Industry leader for a reason, won't buy other brands... are there other brands? Durable, reliable, comfortable - Just do it"
The website experience is overall bad.The quality control in Nike is decreasing over the years.
"Not a fan of the website, I had to call to the store the other day to learn that they actually had my size where it said sold out on the website."
"Been a lover of their sneakers since i was a little girl, so comfy and stylish! Getting a matching cap this week... keep up the good work! Also good customer service, kept me in the loop with my delivery."
"my favourite everyday nikes, very reliable"
Great products  it is my favourite sport brand.
I bought nike football boots which arrived quickly and were an excellent price. Also the return process on pair that didn’t fit was free and simple with a quick refund. Shame sizing is not true to usual uk sizes which makes it hard to buy footwear online
Thought this was a good company that supported fair & equal opportunities for sportsman & woman across the world but corruption in premier league in England proves they don’t & need to ask Richard masters why not? #corruptepremierleague
"Good quality sports wear. A brand you can wear with confidence knowing full well, they don't succumb to corruption. Great sponsor of English football."
Well done Nike on not backing down to murderers and human rights abusers and keeping them out of our uncorrupted league!Love Nike!
"Great trainers to wear, makes a change from my crocodile shoes."
"Best shoes , 360°comfortable. I paied 84£ and after 2 years is still New.I wash it  in the washing machine, with  could water , 1 time/ 2weeks and is still new.It depends how much you are heavy. I have 56kg.So , I love my shoes .I buyed 3 pairs in 6 years."
Hi I had the best experience a little bit of a run around but all worked out in the end.I started at Fairview mall Nike store spoke to Kay and Jarelle helped me good information transferred to Yorkdale finally spoke to  Heather she fixed my problem had my shoes ordered for my son wow   5* all the way
I had a good experience today with Annette that works at Nike in Yorkdale. Her patience and bubbly character made our visit pleasant.
I have owned many different Nike trainers throughout my life and they have never let me down. Excellent quality and designs! Fully recommend.
"My delivery came 3 days before expected! Some sites prioritise full price items, but I ordered one full price item and one sale item and they both came 3 days early, couldn't be improved."
"Ordered from the website, no problems and fast delivery. It was a day late but it was still really fast."
"My order arrived in good time, great shopping experience."
I love Nike so much. It’s always easy to solve any problems with multiple ways to get in contact with them and their team are always friendly and happy to help.
"No issues, ordered 3 kept 2 returned 1 .... EASY AS 3, 2, 1. Much easier than trapsing down to the store."
"Good quality shoes for a good price. I bought 2 pairs of air force 1. Awesome trainers, true classics."
"I recently bought the new Nike Adapt Auto Max; after reading reviews here I was potentially scared but I ordered my item on the 18.07.20 and they estimated delivery to the UK for the 21.07.20. The box came in good condition, delivery was estimated perfectly and happy with the product. Hope this helps."
Decent clothes and trainers always - never had a problem with them.
"I had an issue with an item I received, it was dealt with promptly with no quibbles."
Had an issue with an order I received but the customer service team were extremely helpful and resolved the problem very quickly.
"Ordered multiple items the last few weeks, everything was on sale with great prices, all item arrived on time in perfect condition. Had to return a pair of shoes because they were a size larger than needed, hassle free return procedure, refund arrived a few days later. Very satisfied, and their factory website has better prices than retail shops such as JD, Sports Direct or Schuh."
Excellent customer service from start to end. Easy to order on website or app. Returns are very simple and refund quickly applied. Items sent are in mint and new condition.
It takes I long time until the shoes come And it says that it will come today and guess what did not come to my door which sucks but the shoes are nice.
"Back in March I decided to treat myself to a pair or the AirMax 270's. They didn't have the womens size available so I oredered the mens ones as it really doesn't bother me. I decided because they were mens I would order a size down but upon trying them on I realized I'd made a mistake and I should of gone with my normal size. I jumped on a live chat with someone and they said that I would need to print an exchange label but due to Covid-19 I was unable to do this as I don't have my own printer SO, they told me to use my returns label and get proof of postage, send them the reference number and that they would trigger the exchange manually from their end. Got home, did all mentioned above and within 5 days I had my new shoes in the correct size.Staff were friendly, helpful and speedy so definitely no complaints.I also made sure to complete the Nike survey with the names of the two employees that helped me as I thought they did such a great job."
I shop online with Nike.com frequently. I am impressed with their frequent shipping updates and easy and free returns. Your shopping history is all captured on the Nike.com app as well. The whole process is easy!I can only assume that their rating on here is so low because happy and loyal customers are not leaving the positive reviews Nike deserves.
"Despite the sometimes overpriced products and discount codes that don’t work, I find Nike to be a very reliable company offering high quality products. Any products I’ve bought from them have always been great quality and really comfortable and stay in good condition for a decent amount of time."
Very surprised by the many negative comments regarding Nike's customer service as I've received nothing but the absolute BEST from them in recent months! I was flabbergasted when I discovered their returns policy allowed shoes that had even been worn outside to be refunded for any reason within 30 days (now 60 days due to pandemic). Was even given a 15% discount due to recently missing out on a Nike members promotion! A⭐
My daughter works here. They really look after her.
"Great priced trainers, delivery took a bit longer due to pandemic, but that was acceptable.  Trainers are really comfortable, and better priced than even Sports Direct and other retailers.  Highly recommended."
"Ordered some shoes online the 19th of May 2020. They already said that it would take longer for delivery due to Covid, so the estimated arrival date was the 5th of June. They arrived the 8th of June, so a bit delayed, but  I got some very nice shoes!"
"Wow ordered trainers in wrong size. I cancelled the order on Saturday and was refunded today, now that’s what u call service.. 100 percent recommend.."
"Exceptional customer service. Had to return an item 3 times due to sizing errors and each time I spoke to someone, the rapport and the customer first attitude was refreshing. Well done Nike."
Awesome as always. Nike have to be one of the best companies I’ve used.
Apologies for my last bad review...I had no contact with nike regarding my  delivery for two weeks so I looked up reviews and not to many had a good thing to say so I panicked and thought my order was going to be cancelled like so many others..but since posting my bad review nike finally sent an email regarding postage and tracking and yayyy I finally got my fantastic trainers today three days early...thanks nike 😁😁😁
"I had a good experience buying at nike.com. The website is really easy to navigate, one thing that I did not like so much is that the shipping took really long."
"I ordered a pair of Nike air max 720-818 and Nike air max 200 on 29th may 2020 online. At this time there was a promotional offer for 30% off everything on the store so without hesitating I bought the shoes. When I ordered I waited a bit for them to send confirmation email but it hadn't come but after 4 hours after purchasing online I got the email saying my order has been confirmed.After on the order status it showed processing order and I was thinking when they will dispatch the order (they had given me an estimated delivery time of 11 June) so I waited and yesterday I got en email they had dispatched my order.The delivery took less than 24 hours to arrive by DPD. I received the shoes this morning. So it took 7 days to come which Is reasonable and during this pandemic they had to be more careful so I didn't mind it taking long to arrive.The delivery takes 1 day after they had dispatched the item and an average of 5-6 days to process your order.The shoes are packed in it's original box with another DPD box on top so they are careful on not to damage the packaging and the shoes. They come with a free return label sticker if you want to return the shoes.The quality of the shoes feels amazing and they fit to size. Sleek, comfy and very well made. I have multiple Air Maxes and even own two pairs of the recent 720s but this pair of 720-818 is by far the nicest air maxes I ever owned. Very stylish and comfy. Looks good with almost anything. I went with the black ones and pictures does not do this shoe justice. Good job Nike for designing and creating some of the most innovative shoes on the market. I will continue supporting and wearing as long as you continue making shoes that accommodates the consumers. The shoes and the picture look identical to each other so you recieve what you buy. First off, they're absurdly comfortable. By far the most cushioning of any sneaker I've ever tried, you really sink in with every step. I think it's great but I could see it being TOO much for some people. Still, if you're looking for the ultimate in cushion, here it is. Second, the materials are really nice. The suede is soft, the leather is pretty nice and the mesh panels feel durable. The cork insole is also a nice touch and helps up the comfort. These feel like they'll hold up to a lot of wears and should still look good a little beat up. The color is also nice, muted earth tones contrast nicely with the over-the-top physical design of the show, it definitely makes the shoe feel more wearable. Fit is true to size, but on the roomier side. Overall two thumbs up.I have no idea why the other reviews are really bad, In my opinion the processing is not the fastest (Adidas delivered in 2 days (Including processing time and dispatching)) but the shoes and the packaging is on point and delivery is very fast. I will definitely order again from this site. I ordered 2 shoes to see if they will loose on of them but they did not. Both shoes were delivered by DPD but not together they both had different tracking numbers and boxes.Message to NIKE: Can you send me more discount code or good offers."
It said item was coming on the 23rd of June but actually came on the 4th was very surprised with the very quick shipping 🇮🇪
I’ve been a Nike Member for a long time their customer service is AMAZING I place an order and I receive it Ontime every time their return policy is the best bar none I had to exchange 7 pair of shoes even tho I wore them Nike still honored the exchange I will always be a shoe fan of Nike you guys ROCK
"Ordered on the 26/05/2020 in the 30% sale , didn’t hear anything back even though they took the payment. No confirmation email or receipt so checked here on Trustpilot and seen loads of terrible reviews and was worry so kept checking online tracking of order and trainers have come today 7 days earlier than what they promised."
Great products love them for the workouts and running. Received quickly with free delivery ehwta more could you want
"Amazing service, items came quick and drivers were patient, knocking on door until i was present to receive the parcel. Great."
I received my Nike trainers that I designed. I am so happy with the trainers and well done for keeping me so well informed on delivery. I will get my next pair of trainers from here:)
"Ordered a great amount off of them, they did double charge me but the charge was corrected in a few hours, orders never took longer than a week! Good service and will be dealing with them again"
For the people say that they can't get there order is probably just cause covid 19
Thank you mike
"I can't understand the low rating, I've ordered from Nike twice now and downloaded and ordered from their members app. Both times the orders were dispatched within 3 days and received 2 days later. Even with the pandemic I was given a June 8th date for an order placed 14th may. I received it 19th may. The shoes are awesome, look amazing, comfortable and well made, in both cases. Great service and products!"
"Customer service is like talking to humans! Always great service, CS agents have also frequently followed up via email to ensure I have received packages I have been in touch about and that I was happy with the products."
"I don’t usually leave reviews but I waited on the phone for about an hour and wasn’t really expecting to get such good customer service but LISA IS AN ABSOLUTE GEM, she gave me a discount on my custom shoes that weren’t exactly how I wanted and helped me get my other order figured out within 10 minutes, she deserves a raise!!"
"I ordered 3 pairs of shoes April 30. As expected shipment delays relating to COVID, but came at the dates (about 3 weeks later) expected and was updated frequently on any shipment updates. I also had to exchange one pair and customer service was patient. I had to be on hold as they placed the exchange order and the representative would come back every few minutes to update me that the system was taking a little long in placing the order. Also, I was disconnected twice during the call but was able to resume the order as the representatives were able to communicate with each other find where the order was left off. They were also very informative on the exchanging process and answered all of my questions."
I’ve never had a problem with this company. Everything I have ordered has always come before the expected date.I would recommend this company.
I will never order from nike again I order shoesApril 29 didnt until a month later forget I dont care about covid 19 I ordered my shoes o want them on time
"Excellent customer service. Shipping was a little slow, but understandable given the current situation with Covid. Items arrive new. Return and exchange policy is awesome!"
Product arrived 1 day later but I guess it's due to Covid19
Had a great customer service experience this morning on live chat with Joey. He was very fast and solved my problem.
"Customer services are a bit of a nightmare to get hold of. Quality of products can vary, I have found. Sometimes excellent (mainly with trainers), other times (such as with certain items of clothing), it can bobble quite soon after buying/washing."
"I have bought two trousers from Nike in the past 2 years, both of them got small bubbles very soon, also my Air Max which I bought for leisure time got a hole in the outsole in less than 3 months. However, I am happy with their Kyrie Irving basketball shoes and basketball shorts which are very light."
Received my order 10 days before quoted delivery date
"I placed an order 2 weeks ago today, during the midst of quarantine. I was hoping it would arrive before my partners birthday this weekend, which it did! So that was awesome. However, I was not updated at all that my order was packaged or shipped, only that it had been received so I was pretty stressed. Alongside that, the Nike box was placed into a slightly bigger box with no bubble wrap or other form of filler to keep it from being damaged or tossed around. Overall, shipping was 2 weeks which is very fast imo, updates of order was awful and the way it was packaged wasn’t great either. Would much rather ship from a local retailer like Platypus or Footlocker next time! Just happy they had the type of shoe in stock on Nike.com."
They took a while to dispatch my order. I bought running shoes which are my new favs and are great for my shabby knees. Good student discounts.
Still waiting for my shoes to be delivered ive email and everything still can't tell me what's up? Was due 30/4/2020 it 12 days over due. I highly recommend not to go through Nike.com
"I’m suprised at all the negative reviews because my experience with Nike was great. I ordered shoes 2 weeks ago and was obviously aware that there would be delays. Still however, my delivery arrives 2 weeks before it was expected to and it was easy to track package."
"At first it was a little bit of a bumpy ride but it got better. To be honest, I’m very impressed with the way Nike handled my situation. The first problem with my order was the dispatch. My dispatch email came like a week after I ordered my shoes. On top of that, I had sent 2 emails to customer service about that dispatch email. I had this really nice and caring person who replied to me within a day and my order was taken care of. My suggestion would be if you’re ordering from Nike during this Covid -19 period, prepare to wait at least 2-3 weeks for your order but nonetheless thanks Nike for my good quality shoes!"
"Ordered 2 pairs of trainers on 23rd April, intial confirmation informed my of delivery date of 10Th may which i thought was acceptable given Covid delays. Then received confirmations and had both delivered by today with delivery notifications on the days with an hour slot - both pairs are excellent, slight scuff marks on on of the trainers that rubbed out with a wipe"
"Good but only 3 stars because their postage is a joke. Wait times of around 2 weeks to a month. I ordered at the beginning of April. It stated ""order now to recieve by 5th"". Only after the order did it show that this was May 5th, not April LOL. That has lost them a star. The other reason is because after you pay by card, it shows as pending and they don't take the payment for like 7 days before they will then even post it. I've had many friends with the same frustrations."
"I’m looking at all the reviews and I can see a lot of people complaining or saying nike didn’t deliver their products.However, I ordered my package on the 24th  of April and received it on the 29th of April (despite the app saying arriving 11th of May). Their service is very good and I ordered a hoody and tracksuit bottoms and a T-shirt and they all arrived packaged nicely. All the people complaining about their packages I am slightly worried that some people are not taking this situation to mind and understanding that there is a global pandemic right now. I hope people can acknowledge that maybe your package takes a bit longer than it does, just have some patience. Your not going to die without it and what are you going to do with your new running shoes or fitness clothing? Nothing. Because it’s lockdown. Please be more considerate.I ordered something from Armani and it took so long that I thought it wasn’t going to arrive and I had lost the money. But it ended up arriving. So please understand there is no reason to stress out.Patience is a blessing and test in itself. I hope you all stay well during everything going on and that your families and you are safe. God Willing (Ameen)"
"I can only review my experience, and it has been a first class service from Nike.com, always get a great service from the customer service team too if I have anty queries I have.Always update you where your items are :)"
"not really fan of Nike or any other big labels but I needed resistance band and did place order which was supposed to be delivered in two weeks period (oh Corona!!) well, it arrived in less than 24 hours. Lots of appreciation especially these difficult times. Thank you"
Ordered off Nike website for the first time and I am beyond impressed. Absolutely in love with my Air Force 1’s they go with any outfit. Will definitely be ordering again.
Ordered from nike twice now while this covid-19 is still happening & they have done a brilliant job in delivering my items! They do state that parcels can take up to 1-2 weeks which is understandable but have come earlier than that. Got to give them credit working hard through all of this trying their best to deliver on time!
Thank you Nike . I was notified on Monday & received my order today
Amazing shoes and the fast shipping for being a member is great. I thought I was on the wrong review. Because I order 5 shoes from Nike so far and all my shoes were in perfect Condition and outstanding. And the shoes look like they were never worn. I love Nike and I will continue to order my shoes from them. Customer service also good and if you have a question about a shoe in the app you can message a representative and they will gladly help you so I recommend this site.
"All the bad reviews shocked mi little bit. I own my tenth pair of Nike shoes and I always been a happy with them. Also I have very good experience with Nike.com itself. Well, no customer service but very fast processing of the order (less than two weeks to different country)."
We’ve all been doing Jo Wicks every morning and quickly realised that we needed new trainers. Ordered 4 pairs in the sale and yes the delivery took about a week more than normal but the shoes did arrive and we are very happy. 😁
"I don't understand how people despise Nike on this site and it makes me feel like UK Trustpilot itself cannot be trusted. In my years of ordering things from Nike, I have never encountered any issues, especially when ordering expensive products like Air Jordans. Nike provides a quality service and all of these reviews for them just sound wrong..."
Got a steal on some reacts can't complain shipping times are long still but no need to cry about it big up Nike keep making cool stuff
I ordered pair of lebron 17 two days ago. And it supposed to be shipped on Wednesday. But it came today monday! It was really fast and good!
Just 5* it Again I’m surprised to see such a big brand with such low ratings however I purchased many items from Nike and have experienced nothing but great customer service.  The sales and additional discount codes are spectacular.I order some trainers that quickly went out of stock so the advisor asked if I wanted some similar but none sale trainers - what a great and innovative approach.  Got to love Nike.
"Arrived before due date on a Sunday morning, can’t complain.Size is ok, I see how I feel when I go for a run in them."
"Been a fan of Nike all my life. Mostly I bought my shoes from the store , but I did an exception and this time I ordered online. I found the website easy to use, easy to find what you are looking for and lastly very easy to order. I like that they keep me updated with everything that’s happening with the order. I have received emails regarding the payment, the payment invoice, a tracking link for my order, when the order has been dispatched and so on. The delivery is expected tomorrow and I’m surprised with this because of the lockdown and what is happening now everywhere in the world. I’m very happy that Nike still processed orders and that they’re making their best in delivering on time. For my order it says it’ll arrive tomorrow ( 31st of March).In my opinion Nike shoes are the most comfortable and very durable. I highly recommend"
"Great service, simple webpage, omnichannel, delivery, return policy!"
Ordered Nike Free RN 5.0 Men's Running Shoe from a mail shot by Nike. Received email accepting order with delivery date by 30/3/20. A few days later Nike contacted to me and apologised that product delayed and could not guarantee by 30/3. Although disappointed it was not a big issue with the Self Isolation rules in place so I sat back and waited. On 28/3 I received another email telling me that the product was being shipped and that DPD would be delivering. Happy with that as they are my favourite delivery agent (other than PO). As I have the DPD App I checked today 29th with DPD and was informed parcel on the way to their depot and I would receive on 30th. Alls well that ends well and completely satisfied. Looking forward to my new runners to admire in anticipation of putting to use.
"What a nice gesture This is for you mr Nike Is these pressing times  you can go out in twos, but wouldn’t it be great to go in Nike shoes, to keep active and agile be it hike or bike, be safe, be smart NIKE has my like 👍 and yes it’s really scary out there but NIKE you also get a share, From myself and my familyBE SAFE OUT THERE #nikeclub"
"I was having trouble finding some basketball shoes and Stevie the helper was so incredibly nice. We had a nice conversation about the canceling of NBA, Kevin Durant, and Jusuf Nurkić...... and of course the basketball shoes. If you get to talk to her you are absolutely blessed."
"I bought online and in store many Nike products, to play tennis, run, swim and train in the gym. They deliver first-class durability, style and practicality."
super good vans are trash.
"Its cool and great humble , i like it but the item price is a bit expensive"
"Awesome company with awesome principles and even better customer service. Stacy was prompt, exact, and went out of her way. I love nike and recommend them"
"I have ordered a number of items from Nike over the last 12 months and had to contact their customer services team on a couple of occasions (support with returns, alternative options to returning & refunding the items only to reorder a different size, slight fault on an item etc). I have to say, the online chat is always quick, easy and the agents are always so friendly and knowledgeable. Errors and mistakes happen, but it’s how a company and people deal with them. In my experience with Nike and their customer services team they have always been professional and gone that extra mile. Praise where it is due. A+"
"Nike has good products, I would only wish that they kept making the bonded t-shirts with a T-shaped design. I love those, but can't find them anywhere."
So I was wondering what to get and l have no idea about cleats and I’m 10. So I didn’t know what to do so l just went to the Nike experts so l asked but this one guy really helped me his name was Cesar. I of course didn’t know one thing and Cesar gave me all these options of the cleats I wanted and they were Mike trout cleats! He was awesome he gave me something good about every one! He is awesome totally recommend him so nice and help what can I say that was bad! NOTHING 11/10 give this guy a raise he’s awesome!
I like my nike trainers. Slow delivery.
"I feel like me and my friends whom have disabilities get some what treated fairly right in the world , Me and my friends in the world whom have disabilities  felt offended by the Nike employees and from the Nike.com management team and the Nike lawyers and the security team from Nike world headquarters from Beaverton Oregon they are a great company but a bit greedy with there money for selling there Nike products to the world to world wide athletes and to people with disabilities plus I don't get why don't any of the Nike employees from all over the world don't just agree to choose kindness and for them to agree to leave a lone the police of not to bother them no more to inform the world about them agreeing to also maybe considering to lowering there Nike products for people to be able to buy in there retail stores even on Nike .com and for the Nike employees and there HR people from Nike world headquarters to never say from Nike.com if you continue reaching out to us this means for them to not to say to me or to the world that no one isn't allowed to be calling or writing to Nike employees or directly on Nike.com of chat even if a person from the past if sorry of causing telephone harassment to them all but they shouldn't be strick or rude to anyone in the world .

See Phil Knight urged me to apply on Nikebiz.com for when he sent me a thank you letter in 2012 after meeting him in person and I feel like I was being mistreated wrong by all Nike team management team and by all there employees everyone in the world even me knows that Nike is a big company and knows that we know that Nike gets a lot of applications and a lot of phone calls but why get the police into this matter and even blocking people's phone calls ? This is a concern for the world to know and for me too.

Have seen mixed reviews but Nike always delivers the goods!
Overall it’s an awesome buying experience. Kudos to nike for the excellent customer service and fast shipping.
Good service and access is easyThey have good customer service and always responsive to my needs. No wonder they grow so fast
Not gonna lie i wasn't expecting this kind of response from Nike. As my orders were delayed. They sent me a promotion code which was for free shipping and i am impressed thank you Nike. I think customer service is pretty good and contacts you at closest time so it deserves a great.
mad creps but the jackets are lacking not enough room for the 19 rambo vapormax plus are some sick creps for 150 quid give me the boost so i can catch the ops and dat prefer the shoes that dont reflect so feds dont see u but its personal preference
"Bought from the store, the quality looks ok, customers service could be better though."
Everything arrives on time and product/quality very good. I order at least once a month as big fan of activewear and fitness and Nike always delivers!!! Love it!!
Absolutely love my new shoes. Nike has once again raised the bar. I recommend you to come back to Nike and remember what made them the best.
"I had the best experience with Nike.com, I bought a pair of shoes and they helped me exchange the pair, and when that pair didn't fit me as well, I got my refund in two days! They work so efficiently, their staff if very helpful and they respond quickly, the customer always comes first and you can clearly see that, I am so happy with everything they did for me.The returns and exchanges are very fast, they never have any issues and I will definitely buy from them again!"
"No problems at all, nice products plus i'm kinda a nike junkie myself"
Clothes to shoes too sports stuff Nike is great
"With some recycled materials being present in three-quarters of its products, Nike is an industry trailblazer for sustainability. The Nike Air range of trainers uses at least 50% recycled materials and diverts more than 95% of waste from landfills, plus the company is soon to release a range of trainers dyed with plant-based dyes, which reduces pollution of waterways. Nike’s North American operations aim to be entirely powered by renewable energy by the end of 2019."
Happy with the service and trainers I bought online. Well packaged too!
I like nike. Its usually pretty comfy and easy to puchase.
"I usually shop around,  but the ease of shopping on Nike.com, from the free delivery to very straight forward returns, means that I will always buy directly!"
Best product not the quality
"Quality shoes, 2 year warranty if you order from their website, great customer service"
One thing I didn't appreciate Nike's people at there headquarters feeling like to say to me unkind we don't care if you need reasonable accommodations because of your disability for them to provide me for me to needing help filling out product questions even for knowing of how to fill out a job application . Don't get me wrong they are the best company and know when there co-founder Phil Knight former chairman whom over sees his employees and the retail employees and even consumer's affairs and whom ever of there higher up's and there management team is out standing but they as a company need to not to be a bit strick on anyone with special needs even with out special needs . I have ADA I deserve to be treated right with whom ever from Nike locations in the world I would like there security team of Nike .com and even the Nike HR people of headquarters and whom ever to agree to choose kindness to anyone in the world . But for them not to be greedy with there funds and for them all as a team to agree to leave alone the police of not calling them a lot on any one and not to be blocking people's phone calls all thee above . And there customer service people on Nike.com needs to not get people into trouble . Plus I am truly sorry for what I didn't mean to cause telephone harassment of asking Nike.com team of there management team from my past history why don't you guys don't have to what ever I couldn't find so then they would put me on hold to tell them they have it at there ware house  and they seem to tell me Steven  have you called us again well if a person is needing assistance to whatever it is that I need of my ADA. Do I feel treated unfair by Nike management team and even by the Nike employees of there Nike locations in the world . I was told by the Police in the USA they some how don't like Nike products and don't like how they as a team a bit rude to people in the world. I think Nike to all locations needs to do survey's to all locations in the world to inform anyone in all nations of how people like there products or even if people were treated kindly by Nike employees world wide of all nations as a suggestion and idea . And when buying products on Nike .com and applying for jobs please everyone from Nike and for there team world wide to know is don't say if a person continues telephone harassing you or chatting with you on chat of Nike.com you all will call the police because I was informed that the police will say to you all why are you calling us because they can be annoied by anyone in the world of calling the police a lot then you all would be harassing the police on them . So just chill out on anyone and lay off on the calling to the police and help anyone whom is in need or that is poor with no funds in there hands  help people by helping explain how your things on Nike.com works for buying things on line of if a disabled person needs help of applying for jobs never say you do it on your own because then you would be offending the person to whom ever it is . Thanks Nike.com team to all employees to approve this . I would love to be your Nike fan council to all locations for rating products of Nike.com  please consider me back and I will 100% promise and not say not to do but to agree to abide the rules please Nike employees and management team all thee above please choose kindness at all times said by congressmen of the laws of USA of 50 States . please call me if you do consider me back to your locations . I am the biggest fan of you all your co-founder name Phil Knight whom I met in 2012 is the best co-founder to you all . My name is Steven R Barone . please call me at 541-3599471 or e-mail if you all do consider me back with a fresh start and I agree to follow your rules to present and for a life time . I am sorry for what I shouldn't never done of reaching out to you all of 2016 and 2017 and 2019 didn't mean to do that and that I feel like it was an honest mistake . American disability . I am 31 years old .
It's amazing and it provides everything that is needed
Great trainers. Last forever :)
Sometimes the customer service doesn't want to help you with the type of shoe size and don't have patience with you.
Excellent!I've ordered a few times and the only time Nike messed up with the delivery I have to give them props for making it up to me ( btw DPD fault) sending me a 25% discount code 👍I'll definitely order again and again as at least Nike recognise their mistakes unlike Adidas who will give you absolutely f*** all
"Well I felt like Nike world head quarters said if I continued telephone harassing them of 2016 and 2017 and 2019 they were going to have the Beaverton Police detectives name Dale and his partner name John drive to Eugene Oregon and when I was told by there receptionist from the past to the beginning and said to me what do you want on the phone talking rudely to me and saying what kind of help or accommdations you need for employment so then when there security team and there HR people from Headquarters said Steven we will call you if you get offered an interview or for the job to provide you the reasonable accommodations for job tasks and even we could provide you one of our staff to work with you while you learn to do the job inside the retail store and me accendlty asking them if they can create a job called cashier assistance with helping the cashier's of helping them with putting people's things inside the Nike bag so then it could go faster for the cashier's and not waste time of whatever they are doing so when I got told by there headquarters of Nike.com management team HR we don't have that job Steven Barone American disability even letting them know I got to meet there co-founder name Phil Knight in person with me giving him a friendly hand shake and a friendly warm hug plus Phil Knight sent me a thank you letter saying to me thank you Steven for being the biggest fan of Nike and that he urged me to apply for jobs on Nike biz.com  so when I got chew up badly and poorly by the Nike employees from all locations in the world even in the USA they as a company don't like being bothered for any reason well because they get a lot of applications of people from all over the world applying for Nike jobs and they as the Nike team get a lot of phone calls plus if anyone in the world were to call Nike on themselves Nike would say on there end what do you need not in a nice way when they speak directly to you on the phone and if you continue bothering them it would be called telephone harassment now if you didn't mean to cause telephone harassment meaning like whatever I shouldn't done to them as a Nike employees team of Nike head quarters of Beaverton Oregon how many in the world would say that I deserve grace and forgiveness and to be possibility be reconsidered by to Nike locations with a fresh start of 2020 in there time frame to consider me once again for employment and for shopping on Nike.com and even to there stores as a suggestion and idea should Nike ever prosue of contacting the Police to anyone in the world ever again even I was told that the police some how doesn't like Nike or even anyone meaning to call the police for any reason even to be causing disturbance . I feel 100% offended to what Nike did wrong to me and because they are a powerful company they sure enjoy bothering the police on there end . I as a American disability do forgive Nike for what they shouldn't done by calling the police on there end and because the congressmen of the laws are fed up with Nike company in the world even how Nike shouldn't never reached out to the police in 2016 and even other times on me or to anyone . See My experience is the store manager name Danny from Eugene Nike retail store was a bit rude and cranky to me in 2018 for when I was okay to be considered back to Nike locations and of me being truly sorry for my mistakes . My hope is hoping Nike excepts my sorry for whatever I shouldn't done to them from the beginning to the past of 2016 and 2017 and 2019. Plus I am a Team USA fan council that is truly offended and even emotional . I would like to be considered back to Nike locations with Nike making an aprovable on there end and considered it for me to be allowed to do whatever is okay to do or not okay to do so if I get a fresh start to be allowed back to there locations in the world even in the USA I agree to follow there rules and would like there management to agree to leave the police alone and for them all and there staff on Nike,com and there retail people all thee above even on Headquarters staff HR people to agree to choose kindness at all times . President Trump and the congressmen of the law would like anyone that is a tax payer to agree to choose kindness for a life time and not to greedy with money and self-fish and mean to anyone on the phone even in customer service and for anyone to abide the rules of the law and to be nice to people with special needs even with special needs please call me anyone to aprove of this of me being truly sorry to Nike employees and there management team and for them to consider back to there locations and even all thee above and that I agree to no longer for a life time not to cause no more for the future to present for telephone harassment etc . 541-3599471. I would love to be a Nike fan council for Nike products to all nations .Steven Roy Barone 31 years old . plus my adopted parents are fed with Nike and even the police . I feel like Nike needs to lay off on the police on anyone world wide of all nations and maybe have everyone world wide except not to be causing telephone harassment all thee above . Plus I am offended how Nike when they allowed me back from the past there people were rude at there retail stores even on Nike .com for customer service people of Nike . I am very concerned of why Nike employees and there chairman and there former chairman doesn't know how there people at Nike is mistreating anyone with special needs even with out special needs seems like ever since Phil Knight the Nike co-founder stepped down as the chairman and is now part of board of directors to Nike company of headquarters should look and see why Danny the store manager from Nike retail store felt like being a bit rude to me then getting me into trouble because I shouldn't be reaching out to his store from the beginning to the past do I owe Nike employees a huge sorry for my mistakes ya I do and I except there forgiveness can I to present and to a life time when they ask me to stop reaching to them a lot on chat even on the phone can I abide there rules if I get invited back to there locations yes I can  hoping they allow me back to there locations this year of 2020. My handicap is learning disability Asperger's slight handicap .  So I realize I was truly mistaken from my past from whatever I shouldn't done to Nike employees of of bothering them and by asking them a lot of questions and by them providing me reasonable accommodations if when I do apply for jobs I agree not to be calling but waiting paitently for them to only call me or to anyone they decide to call  and I agree with the terms 100%."
I love the website and I love how easy it is to create my own styles with personal swag
"Most of shoes are quality, but if u purchase more, u may meet some quality issue shoes, but easy to return or exhcanged."
"It takes forever for products to come but seriously, i've never been scammed. Every product has been great it just takes so damn long to get to me!"
"I love Nike! Everything is overpriced, but I live 5 minutes away from an employee-store and my neighbors work at Nike so I can get in with a pass and receive the 40% discount. The clothing is stylish and useful at the same time, and the shoes are as well. However, the shoes wear out pretty fast, so don't expect to buy them and have them last for three years, as they won't. If Nike was a bit cheaper, I would give this company a 5-star review! :)"
Buying online was extremely easy. Did a lot of Christmas shopping here and all was delivered on time and quality was exceptional.
"I generally wear an M size but decided to order the S size and it was a wise choice. This short is a fleece-like material inside, a little warm, and snug in the small size for wearing them playing tennis- the small size gives a little support, and the stretch in the material is enough so that having 2 tennis balls in my pocket doesn't cause any binding restriction of movement.They are also good for just lounging around in - the two front pockets are generous and I can easily carry my keys, and phone without fear of them falling out. The back pocket is equally sized and the snap ensures that when I have my wallet with me it will remain secure.I have washed them before wearing and the shrinkage is minimal- the blend of material doesn't dry very quickly but even hang drying the fabric stays soft."
"I order a lot from this site and let me tell you, they're amazing. They have numerous products, quality shoes, clothes and accesories for sports and they come with a good price too! If you are looking for such things like different sport-outfits, balls, anything for every kind of sport, I can recommend Nike."
"As I have a Nike Run Club account, I am eligible for free next day delivery (UK).  I have only ordered a couple of times from Nike, but both times I received my order when specified and have had no problems.  I would purchase from them again."
Easy to do business with! Thanks so much!
"I have twice now sent back returns with Nike via Cycleon, both times they were signed for but never got back to Nike and they refunded the sales. Can’t complain excellent customer service"
"We ordered boots for our son serving in the Air Force and on deployment in the middle east.  He got the order quickly and in perfect condition, good job Nike!"
Been happy with all my purchases so far. Customer service was very good! Which was surprising as these reviews seem to be 1 stars. All my items that i had purchased took exactly 3 days to deliver which is great! 👍
"I ordered a hoodie on black friday, then tried to exchange it for a bigger one but they ran out of stock and refunded me instead - I was so disappointed because I loved the hoodie. However, I called customer serviceagain (5-10 minute wait) and I got a 20% off code which I'll use towards the goretex air force 1s."
My favorite brand clothes. Always order it whenever I need it for my training and the delivery is great. Do not miss out on the opportunity to get nice clothes.
"Ordered two shirts for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift. Shipping was super fast and  the quality of the shirts feel really good. Not sure about the fit, but the correct sizes were delivered and I received updates on the status of my order. Overall the ordering and shipping process went super well."
"I absolutely love the shoes. However,  can you please make these new releases in solid black and solid white so they can be worn to the work place? These colors are ridiculously bright and not allowed at work. I'm only giving a 3 star since I can only wear your shoes casual instead of having all day comfort everywhere."
Good footwear but quite pricey and early signs of wear and tear
"good shoes,bit pricey but important to stay ahead of the trends. must say I am disappointed in the shipping delay I experienced on more than one occasion."
Order some airmax 95s from black friday got them for £63 which is well good considering they are in JD at £130 amazing bargain good xmas present they fit true to size aswell the 95s will 100% be using again
"Cannot fault Nike UK on this, great service via online and got some great bargains with Trainers, 3 pairs for about £200, nike 95's and 2 pairs of Tailwind 4. Think this is about the fair price for them not £130 to £150Fast delivery.However having now read other reviews concerning treatment of labour and quality I am a little sceptical about the product, I expect these trainers to last years.............keep tuned."
"One of the only companies that don’t mess about I order regularly and from ordering to receiving the goods is absolutely excellent and fast , also customer service is without doubt one of the best I’ve encountered. Best regards your loyal Nike plus member Bobby"
I have ordered from Nike a number of times and I am always really pleased with the service. The checkout process is straightforward and the items are dispatched very quickly. I receive my orders usually around three days after placing the order. I will continue to order from Nike as I have had no issues and receive my items really quickly :)
"I actually haven’t bought anything from Nike but I am just wondering for anyone that has, I want to purchase airmax 97s and I am usually a size 7 but are they big fitting. Should I get a size up or should I go for a 6.5 if someone could get back to me that would be great thanks"
"Bought some sneakers from Nike GB and they arrived, in great condition, two days later. Communication at every step of the way. Perfect, simple and plain. The third time lucky for me, having had an order for the same trainers, cancelled twice by a third party retailer, due to no stock. Sometimes, you've got to go to the source."
"Only writing this because Nike has such a bad and undeserved rating on Trust Pilot. Their delivery is one of the quickest I have had. The app is useful and simple to use and their products are top quality.People are giving 1 star reviews because their product came one day later than specified, which shouldn't be the case, so I just want to clarify that."
"bad seam, threads come out, quality is not worth the money"
Nike is a great clothing outlet especially for teenagers because it follows latest fashion trends.
Nike has nice products but horrible working conditions in china.
Well known brand with varying quality but great design. can get expensive at times
Decent. Wide variety of items but the kicks I was looking for were not available.
"Fast dispatch and delivery, high quality products 10+++"
Nike has amazing products. like it :)
"quality brand everytime, Just got my airmax"
"The website is ok, however, I think the delivery is actually slow, it takes 7 days to deliver, I could easily order something from eBay or amazon in 3-5 days. But I like the design of the website"
nike products are amazing but their work ethics are not.
Hey Nike i got myself some Kyrie's 5's and i only used them for like 4 times and that is to go out with my mom and dad but when i have wear them i noticed that they have a pump and i have a basketball game next week i think you guys should at least put something I could not prevent that because I have gotten blisters on the back of my heel because of it.
"Excellent trainers, really quick delivery. but didn’t have my size in the colour I wanted, other than that service great."
It’s vary epic from epic games and vary daddy mom and the shoes are vary shoewe andthe closet is vary shape and the cars go vroom vroom
"I love my new running sneakers, can't wait to run my first half with them :)))))"
Everything is good just wish they would make sweatpants for women in tall sizes.
"Like Nike, awesome sneakers and great taste."

Nike Great Britain - best online customer service I have ever experienced. Also super fast delivery and returns.
"I love Nike trainers and activewear, I’m never disappointed. Lovely designs and comfortable clothes and shoes, as well as excellent service. Always happy."
"Reliable and consistent quality.  Never made a bad purchase here. I also like that I am a ""member"" and get free shipping although I am sure I never paid for a membership.  Prices are high, but the quality is worth it.  Wait for sales."
"A very good website, easy to use, fast delivery."
The best quality sportswear for me. Recently thought that I give preference to this brand for 10 years. Thanks
"I bought the Nike daybreak sneakers at Nike.com UK. I made the mistake as I wanted to pick up at Nike store at the first place, but I type the address wrongly and I was not in UK at that moment. eventually I seek for help on their website and chat with Lawrence, he’s extremely helpful, as I change the delivery address very last minute and the parcel has been dispatched from Nike, he helped me to chase the parcel and re-sent them at the correct address on time, very impressive!!!"
"Awesome,good site to shop."
My trainers arrived quickly. Good quality. Perfect for my runs.
Nike is an excellent company with exceptional service. I actually am leaving a review based on the experience I just had. Thank you Nike!
"Fantastic customer service on live chat, on 2 occasions, each with a different person. Solved my query without any hassle!"
Always the best quality! I was never disappointed with the quality of their shoes or clothing. I wish some things were more accessible to people outside of USA tho!
"I recently had to return a hoody as when it arrived it was bigger than expected. Their returns process is easy to follow, free and a courier collected my item in a hour slot and Nike sent me a refund within 48 hours of the collection. Well done Nike for your fantastic customer service."
Ordered two pairs of running shoes within a few days of eachother. Both arrived quickly and well packaged.I chose one pair and returned the other. Returns were free and the return label was in the box. You can also reuse the box if you open it correctly and then use the sticky strip provided to secure it for posting or courier. Less than 48 hours later I got an email confirming my return had been received and then a few hours after that the refund was actioned.Very impressive service.I feel the products are a little pricey but very comfortable.
AwesomeLove you guys
Great service. Great trainers highly recommended
Never disappointed with my gym gear and trainers
"All shoes, clıthes and other products were excellent. Best quality!"
Nike.com costumer service is something to cry over.Nike.com + Dpd delivery service is a nightmare you can't wake up from.update; The second time many months later went much better. So i raised my stars a bit.
You can’t just ignore nike because of its great value and goods
Great trainers 👟 My son loves your stuff Keep up the good work Nike! Angela x
"Just great, ordered some trainers from this site on a Friday night before bank holiday and they came on the Sunday of bank holiday! Great customer service I was updated constantly and I could even book an exact time that I wanted my parcel delivered, there’s also always great sales on certain items at the Nike shop. 10/10"
"My first purchase from Nike. Got some Jordan clothing. Excellent product, great price, but slow shipping. Ordered on August 6th, received on August 12th."
"Bought a pair of sneakers for my wife through Nike.co.ukThe delivery company, UPS, delivered when I was not home and so they took it back with them.I arranged another delivery time and the item did not come.After querying I was told that they have misplaced the parcel.I contacted UPS and they said I should contact Nike for the refund. Have contacted Nike numerous of times via email but have received no response. I have sat on the phone to their call centre for hours on end to no avail.I have spent a lot of money on a product that I have not received and NO ONE wants to take any responsibility for the parcel and I am having to foot the bill.Coming from two major companies, Nike UK and UPS this is SO disappointing.I am so frustrated.It’s been a few months and I have received neither my money nor an apology nor my wife’s shoes.I am a frequent customer of Nike but after this I will NEVER purchase from Nike Uk again."
"I had a really great experience with this company. One hour time slots , good communication and on time deliveries and good returns. Thanks"
"Nice products, service quite unhelpful but that's okay"
I love this company! The vast selection of trainers is absolutely magnificent! I'd love it if they let you design your own like some other companies;
Love Nike products just a full new gym kit. No complaints. Dont think they deserve such a low score on trust pilot.
"Amazing customer service ,always quick delivery which can be tracked every step of the journey, super return policy and quick to refund if needed ! Excellent ."
Excellent service always really quick delivery.All companies seem to get negative on here. Does anyone actually take a trust pilot review seriously? You’d never shop anywhere if you did
It was amazing service.I love nike quality.
"Okay experience. nice shoes, bad delivery time"
I ordered a pair of nikes that i couldnt find in stores they got here in less than a week no mishaps no issues and correct size. Cant speak for everyone experience but mines was great def gonna order from them more often
"My go to for sports wear and trainers, love the products they produce and never had an issue using them, but items are getting more and more expensive with little product improvement to justify it."
I always choose nike over any other brand when it comes to shoes!
I liked the Nike shorts and shoes I bought- I would like to wear Nike shoes every day as they are super comfortable !!
"Mr Bill and Phil I think your spokes person has just ruined your business here in the United States of America. I will personally help you get out of this country by never supporting you, your products or your company from this date forward...no matter what your decision may be..... You just lost my business....its good in a way because now I won't have to pay for your over priced piece of s--- slave made products anymore...go some where else with your s--- show....Don't you realize that this is the kind of publicity that fuels racialism, you should be ashamed you fell for the trap ..remember we were all slaves at one time or another look at the history of coal mining and the the building of our great railroads....please keep on going as you are leaving Arizona ...take your greed to another country and pay more US tariff tax instead of the procurement of tax breaks or incentives from anymore states in this great country...You'all must be Dumacrats"
Best brand for t shirts and shoes
i bought t-shirt. but i don't think there's big difference. it's a little expensive.
I bought a basketball and I'm happy with it. Good service but it took two weeks to get to my house.
"Best Equipment In The World For Soccer Products!I was deciding between buying Nike and Adidas for my soccer equipment for Summer Season, and I decided to buy products from both companies. After initially buying soccer cleats from Nike and Adidas, I instantly realized the contrast in quality. The Nike Hyper Predators were the most comfortable cleats I had ever worn, and in terms of tightness and material design, they were exceptional. The Adidas Predators, on the other hand, were tight, developed with poor materials, and seriously strained my foot. After attempting to use both at practice, I realized that Nike was miles ahead of Adidas, and I decided to buy the entire Bundle. Great work from the best athletic company in the world!"
Perfect company! Great quality of products
tenho tênis legal recentemente. Meu treinamento CrossFit está ficando mais confortável
"Great products, fast delivery, quick assistance, kind personnel. 5 stars!"
"I am absolutely delighted to see that Nike has some work out kits for 'plus sized' customers! There are now 'plus sized' shop-dummies on display in store to show what the kit would look like on larger people like me! It's so wonderfully refreshing to see this as for larger people, it can be really intimidating and humiliating to go into a sports shop like Nike. Thank you Nike for including us in your range and especially for displaying 'plus sized' dummies in your stores - it's so nice to feel welcome in your shops."
"If you're looking for good quality, highly resistant sportswear, look no further than Nike."
Always a pleasure. Great customer service too.
Bought a new football kit and came very quick on standard delivery
Bought some sneakers which came 1 day before delivery should of came. Best place to buy shoes.
This company is very pioneering in this field .. I consider myself the best choice. I grew up and I enjoy the products that accompany the poor to dream of wearing decent fashion like the rich
Shoes work but customer service is VEEEEEERRY slow. I like the shoes though so I can not give too bad of a review. Onward.
Nike shoes are always the best.
Fantastic customer service; quick and efficient
"So many negative comments about Nike. They aren't the best brand around sure, but can't deny the quality of their product. They also know how to market it very well, so i really can't understand all the hate."
I bought a pair of shoes some months ago for around $80 and they’re already starting to break.
Wow I’m surprised at the negative reviews how can you really complain about Nike? They are pricey sure but I’ve never regretted a purchase I’m a huge fan. Performance wear such as the Pro Combat are far above the competition in my opinion they fit great they look great I have nothing bad to say about Nike.
These shoes are amazing and are very comfortable. because it is now the only shoe i will wear. they also have great ankle support and help me play basketball.
I like Nike They make me look cool
My new nike socks feel so nice. the shipping was so fast .
best brand I have ever seen
great kicks! no material for customization in your beverly hills store pretty sad
I was recently at your store Las Vegas is South Premium Outlet Mall I was looking for some Nike slippers and a sales clerk named Krysi help me look and we couldn't find it she searched and searched and searched she went above her job description to try to find me these slippers after numerous calls and her headphones a worker came from the back with the slippers I was overjoyed she searched and didn't give up she was like a tiger it would be my pleasure to go back and find her again the shop once again even though she doesn't get Commission
Love my new air max really fast shipping too.
"5 Stars, great products"
Great design but quality could be better (Pegasus 35)
Amazing Shoes!
yea so i not believe big company have so bad review? my nike shoe good & last long time. alway have nike since child. i have good experience on website buy shoe for jog & deliver fast & make my color custum!
Fast delivery. Good looking running shoes.
"I ordered shoes from Nike's online store, that are size 6, but after receiving the shoes which I've ordered that where supposed to be size  6, my orders shoes size was a size 7."
My Nike Epic React sneakers that I bought a year ago are still good till this day. They are very fitting and light and I feel super comfortable when I run in them. Will definitely recommend this pair of shoes to others!
"Great trainers, delivered quickly and very pleased."
I have a pair of Nike shoes since 2010 and still impec!
"Nike customer service is really really good. Super nice, helpful, efficient, attentive... I could go on but I’ll stop here. Thank you :)"
"I do like nike shoes, and i got nike shoes from the newburgh mall they were nike just do it i got them months ago, and they still look brand new, its not the brand its how u take care of the shoes."
I’ve had mixed experiences but mostly good. Their service could maybe be a little better sometimes but I’m happy with my last 2-3 purchases.
Love my new nike running sneakers! I highly recommend the Nike Zoom Pegasus sneakers to anyone that is a long distance runner. They are super comfortable and come in a variety of colors
"I got Nike air from Nike store and they are very comfortable, the price was okayish"
"I bought some nike shoes for back to school later on in the year I signed up for track and practice is everyday mon-fri I wore my nike shoes since I didn't want to mess up my adidas NMD's. THESE shoes lasted 2 weeks before they started making my ankles hurt like HELL as I was running. And before someone tells me that my shoes weren't made for running they were In-season Tr 8s! I have never had problems with nikes before, I think nike is overpriced and ugly!"
"I had cause to return some trainers that I bought from Nike.com as they were faulty. I can’t fault the customer service I received. The customer service staff were sympathetic and helpful and after returning the trainers using the label that was provided electronically, I received a refund.  I’d buy from the website again."
i am a former employee and customer of the company....its great! i just moved to my original state where i just graduated from and will try for a transfer! swoosh!!!!! #4Life
Always liked their products! Liked the sneakers I got today
"Well I bought a Nike Air Presto recently for my brother, it cost me around $250. The prices according to me are pretty must higher and the quality is also not up to the mark the shoes got tore from the front, Although they replaced it but I don't think so it's going to last for more as it used to before."
"I wear the Nike Mercurial Superfly for my football games and the fitting is just so comfortable for my feet. I play football often and I tried many pairs of boots before, but nothing comes close to this.The boot is very light, but the material used did not compromise the features such as the surface of the boot, the responsiveness of it and last but not least, my touch of the football when I receive or make a pass. Nike has really outdone themselves and I highly recommend Nike anyone who wants to get a pair of football boots."
Why all the poor reviews? My experience with Nike online has been exceptional with refunds and delivery being instantly.Keep you up to date with delivery and even time slots to the hour. Keep up the good work Nike one very happy customer 👍
I always wear Nike sneakers but after what happened to Zion Williamson I'll reconsider buying I Nike sneaker again! I realize this is a isolated incident but this is just terrible what happened to him!
"Nike.com is the most reliable website to shop on for athletes, coaches, and people who like wearing comfortable sports wear. Nike.com is especially beneficial to last minute shoppers and people who don’t like waiting, like myself. I often shop last minute and have looked at other websites that have nice stuff that I’d want to buy, but their shipping was like two weeks wait which made me turn away. Also I have shopped on Macy’s to get some sports wear and their was a max amount of money I had to spend on items in order to get free shipping and I barely wanted to pay for what I had in my shopping cart. In comparison, Nike.com has free shipping for members and their shipping is two days to no more than a weeks’ wait. With all of the other websites I have shopped on like Macy’s, Sporting Goods, Footlocker, and Eastbay: when I finally signed up for Nike.com and shopped, I realized I found that I found my perfect match. I have always been the type of kid who sees something she likes and go buy it whenever I get the money so even when I came up with just $20 I’d go on Nike.com to buy me a T-shirt which I couldn’t do on Macy’s with their max spending rule. When christmas was coming up I knew I could rely on Nike.com to get my shipment in time to give gifts. Nike also sells baby clothing, so options are not limited to age or gender. All in all I believe Nike.com is the best place to shop for athletes and last minute shoppers. Nike is the best place for me."
KD 11 : Il love it.
"Nike has the coolest sportswear clothes out of all the big brands. Pricy, but quality material."
Decent quality stuff when I eventually get it.... DPD are atrocious-please stop using them Nike!!I’ve had to literally sprint after DPD vans stopping in front of my flat and then just driving off saying “we tried but you were out” on their mobile message service (good sprint training but not great when you’re not donning your fitness attire). NOT YET HAD ANY SECCESSFUL PARCELS with DPD as courier.... Thanks Nike through I do love your range but the effort you have to go through to get it is... energy consuming.
"I didn’t receive my package, but all I had to do was call and tell customer service. They were so polite and caring."
best shoes! I love it!
An awsome and fashionable designs... i also love the way hey present their outfits and fashionable designs.....
Great! I love this brand
"I met Nike when I bought my brother's sneakers. This is a favorite brand of shoes. Let me think and I will try, and bought the shoes of this brand. Don't buy just was not possible. Such soft, light, covers the foot so quietly that it seems as if you don't go in them, and fly. Man is constantly in motion. Therefore, it is very important to pay attention to what we go. The lucky ones are those who can afford to choose shoes to taste, not paying attention to its cost, the rules of the dress code and fashion.Buying the first sneakers was memorable for me. Bought easily, found quickly, fell in love at first sight, served at the highest level, the price was satisfied, and as soon as I put them - I realized that this is what I was looking for. My first running shoes were NIKE"
"Professional company with great customer service. I am going out my way to write a review to give credit where credit is due. The deal at the time was too good to miss, and the product arrived before the expected delivery time. There was an issue upon arrival but this was quickly rectified with the upmost professionalism. The representative put customer experience at the forefront. The issue was resolved quickly and without any issues. In fact I was left with a happy smile on my face and a great perception of how customer services should be with other companies. I can not fault Nike and because of the experience they provided me with I will return for further orders."
Nike uses photo of women who need a bigger size!Good evolutionThanks to serve all!
love Nike! it is all I wear and they have a  diverse inventory. Some of their joggers are actually appropriate for casual days at the office!
no idea why theres so many bad reviews ordered my trainers 11pm wednesday and have arrived today (friday). spot on !
Had Nike trainers all my life all I will wear unfortunately quality is slipping recently bought 97s felt ok to start with but bit ankle rub anyway wearing coupe time became very uncomfortable caused foot pain spoke to friends who also say the same don’t buy they look nice but cheap made also £140 down the drain not fit for purpose
"Im just in love with nike clothing and shoes. Ordering clothing for myself and kids, and never ever had any issues with delivery or DPD, very quick shipping, never had any problem with refund too, if I don’t like the item or it doesn’t look good on me, it is very easy return policy."
I ordered some shoes online for my 6 year old and upon delivery discovered I'd been sent some adult ladies shoes. Phoned customer services to advise of error and they were brilliant. Gave me a full refund for the shoes I didn't get. Sending out another pair of shoes which I originally ordered for free. I can send back the wrong shoes in my own time. We all make mistakes but its how we deal with them that makes the difference.
"Amazing attendants in every shop i go to gives me a smile just by entering the door and being nicely treated, will be loyal and only buy from nike always"
The delivery times are quite fast and I love the products.Customer service is so good and polite. Friendly staff and they helped me a lot in my purchasing. love this brand all time favorite one.
"Awesome I buy items very often at nike.comThe delivery times are quite fast and I love the products. The reason why they got a 4 stars is because 1 time out of many purchasesI have made, they sent me the wrong model and wrong size of shoes, sadly they didn't have the model advertised online. However when I contacted customer service they gave me a prompt answer during the chat, got my money back and even a discount code. I have continued buying with them after that."
"I bought new shoes to play football, this time I went for the mercury CR7 ones they are really amazing would recommend!"
best products available - most stylish and slick gear
Great trainers rubbish website and delivery
"Would anybody know would my shoes get to me by Friday, there in Düsseldorf now so I’m not sure"
Ordered two products online here and received in good time. Very good eco friendly packaging.
"Awesome leggings, the nike pros especially. So durable for all my workouts. Hands down my go to brand for leggings!"
I was so impressed by the Nike ID. My shoes look and feel amazing and they came in two weeks early. I was so shocked and excited to see my shoes at my door step. Thank you Kobe for the killer shoes.
The customer service is great!
Fantastic communication- delivery on time. Trainers up to the usual Nike high standards. Well done! My daughter will be delighted when she has her 97’s this Christmas 🎄
"This review is exclusively for the Jordan brand of trainers, I’ve experienced issues in regards to the quality check of the Jordan branded trainers have purchased several pairs and on 3 occasions the trainers had some kind of damage I received another pair of Jordan retro 5 trainers yesterday and upon opening the package I noticed one of the trainers has slight damage at the back extremely dissatisfied that once again I have to go through the complaints process to get a exchange or a discount for the damage, Nike.com really does need to sort out it’s quality control of the Jordan trainers as I’m a collector of these trainers and I expect them to be in A1 condition"
Top customer service today by Francesca online. Needed help with a return and it was so easy and simple! This is the third time that Nike have been amazing. And 20% off for cyber Monday too! Thank you!
"I’ve spent a lot of money through Nike.com and they’ve never let me down so far. I’ve bought mostly footwear but also clothing and some accessories.Dispatch and delivery is quick and the courier company is one of the best as they give you a 1 hour time slot so you can run errands and make it back in time to receive the delivery.Every single thing I’ve received has always been packaged well and nothing has been damaged in transit.On the rare occasion I’ve had an issue it was with their hypercool baselayer tights that had the Nike Swoosh peel off on two separate items through no fault of my own. I spoke to a lovey guy through the online chat and explained my issue. He seemed to actually care, was very professional and personable and arranged for me to send the items back with the returns pack he sent to me and refunded me for the items plus something extra for my troubles. I just wanted a pair of tights that didn’t have the swoosh peel off but this was honestly the next best conclusion. I loved that by sending the tights back Nike’s relevant department could see what the issue was and resolve it for future products.Their app is extremely easy to use and I love their easy returns and great 30 days change of mind policy. It takes the stress and worry from buying online. Although I just wish their clothing was as durable and long lasting as their footwear."
Great Customer Service online regarding faulty items.
Excellent customer service and products if I’ve ever experienced a problem with a Nike product it was resolved had to go through a process but still a good experience would highly recommend
"Great brand, great products and decent website. Website itself is buggy and glitchy at times- but the assortment is generally good, decent size availability, works with cash back sites, great range of postage / shipping options (standard, next day, preferred day etc), and if things go wrong... customer services are responsive and free returns... you can return in store and online which is also an added bonus. Only had an issue with a couple of orders, but the majority have been great."
"I looked at reviews on here but took the risk anyways as the deal was too good to miss, I’m so glad I did the item has been printed and arrived really quickly I can’t fault them at all, usually read these and not post but I’m confused why they have such low rating x"
"This bra is great no frill, doesn't ride up or move around and keeps things in place well. its great bra for serious exercise."
"Average, not outstanding but does what it said on the tin so can't complain too much."
I adore sportswear. This brand is following me since I made my first steps. Their clothes is so quality and good that I don't care anymore how much they cost.
"I did a live chat with Angelita a customer service representative for Nike.com today regarding a return for two shoes and she was extremely kind to take the time to help me look up my item and stayed online all the way until the end of the transaction. Plus, she was very courteous and patient while I searched for my return slip that I got from the UPS store. She provided an outstanding service and showed complete professionalism throughout! I hope every customer will get a service as I did from her! Have an awesome day and I wish you nothing but the best Angelita!"
"Total pleasure dealing with Ann in the customer service team. No wait time, super responsive, and super pleasant. Problem was solved in minutes."
"Wonderful sneakers, TOP"
I love their colorful fancy sneakers ! :) But not very easy for running though
I was on the Nike website ordering some shirts and i was .5 over my giftcard around. I chatted with their customer service rep and he gave me a small discount code which helped me be able to afford my bag on my gift card. Thanks for a great experience
"I see where you just gave an endorsement to a young man with cerebral palsy. I applaud you doing that. Now to make it even better you need to kick Colin Kaepernick to the curb, because Colin Kaepernick does not deserve to be anywhere near the same platform as the young man with cerebral palsy."
Love nick products but they are so expensive now I can’t afford them 😞
I recently visited a local Nike store they refused to refund my Adidas flip flops absolutely fuming. The person I was speaking to was called Matt when i came in with my guide dog he refused to let it in I am blind from the waste down my dog is typing this right now woof woof motherucker
Good products however they don't care about customers
"I love nike, everything they have become and continue to do...but i have a major issue with snkrs pass..   Only select cities?  NY and Chicago and LA...   What about Orlando? Miami?  and other cities..  every city should have an opportunity to get limited shoes....  i mean between the secret drops and snkrs pass and bots, it makes it unfair for the average joe... i want to give you 5 stars but the fairness is a big factor for me..."
"I bought the white men’s vapormax’s and damnnnn these shoes are so comfy and so cool. Delivery was organised when I was in Dubai to the UK very swiftly, the package came well packaged and looked great. Great customer communication and parcel tracking."
"I applaud Nike when they stand, kneel, join hands with athletes like Colin Kaepernick. Nike's support is formidable and valuable. I've been a long-time Nike customer. They keep me running. Now about those sweatshops..."
"good quality, fast delivery"
"I like your Logo and I like your clothes and shoes,they are very good for sports.When I wear it and I feel so comfortable.I hope that you don't change."
Nice to see a company taking a stand on important social issues.
I think that Nike is the best shoe company right now based on statistics and sales. That's just my opinion and there are way more pros than cons if someone trie to dabate.
"Very good quality tennis shoes. I will always be a customer, even if Trump endorses his own golf shoes. Great job!"
I bought a pair of trainers here recently and honestly i had a good experience with them. They showed clearly their prices and sizes and I was able to receive my package on time.
"Thankful to support a company whom believe all lives are created equal and worthy to be treated with dignity & respect. So sad individuals value a flag and a ceremonial song sang before an event rather than the life of someone other than their on race.  As long as African American are being slathered no one cares but their own race of people.  However, just suppose the shoe was on the other foot and African American cops where killing innocent unarmed white people most definitely all the negative feedback wouldn't be projected towards Nike. No suprise all the hate is coming from those whom see themselves as superior to minorities (Blacks)? Remember HATE is a CANCER !!!!!!!"
Thank you for standing up and out !!!  I'm not really excited about your products But because of your new ad I just bought a Nike shirt.
Love the new ad..everyone is entitled to freedom of speech and to stand or kneel for what they believe in.. haters always gonna hate so let them..
Nike ! From head to toe! Big ups for new ad campaign!
As a business owner shame on you .  Having a bonfire with Nike shoes in my yard.
Go Nike. Disregard  the president's medling. He really needs to focus on mending the con try not rip it up. Just do it bro.
GREAT JOB NIKE! Love that you are supporting what’s right. I will continue to wear and buy Nike. I’m ordering some Nike huraches as we speak. Support CK ALWAYS
"I'm so proud to wear my Nike products! From now on, we will only be buying Nike exclusively.  Bravo for having the courage to support Kaepernick's message about equality and justice FOR ALL. It amazes me how many people are so easily threatened by a person kneeling in protest of injustice and inequality. Kudos to your company for giving a voice to the voiceless."
"I am a coach of a major college football program.  To a person on the team... we are abandoning Nike products.  I cannot imagine a more divisive campaign than endorsing a truly anti-American sentiment and someone who cannot find a reasonable and appropriate platform to address their concerns.  Sad.  I grew up admiring Nike.  Now I despise everything Nike stands for.  Say goodbye to hundreds of shoe deals, endorsements, and consumer purchases.  Your CEO needs to apologize immediately to a majority... but I suspect that won’t happen.  Good.  I want Nike to fail and I believe the leadership will assist in this cause.  Thank you."
"Thank you, Nike, for doing the right thing. I haven’t bought your brand for many years. No reason, just haven’t. When I read that you took a chance on Mr. Kaepernick I was so delighted!  You have my highest respect. This week I’m going to buy my first pair of Nikes for myself (bought for kids years ago but they are grown). I have two small grandkids and I am going to buy them Nike’s, too. They don’t need shoes right now but I am going to support you because you did what no one else would do. You stepped outside the box. You JUST DID IT!!!!!  Thank you!!!"
Thank you Nike for supporting Kaepernick’s!  I will absolutely support your decision... I wil always buy your Brand.. Myself and my children will buy 2pairs each this weekend!!! Thank you for your supportBestCynthia Ross 4/ever
"Disappointed .. another mega company getting involved in politics.. you started selling apparel , what has changed.. go too rich..and nothing to do with your time.. diisapointed"
"Nike we are""Just doing it"" you just lost  some very big customers. We are throwing our Nike stuff out. Very bad and disappointing choice in signing Kappernick"
LOVE NIKE!!! LOVE THE NEW AD!! YOU ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY!!
So glad you’ve decided to be on the right side of history and stand for racial justice and the first amendment. Will do more to support Nike moving forward.
Glad to see Nike give voice to a sad problem in America.  They understand the real issue and aren't afraid to speak truth.  Going out to buy new Nike clothing today in support!
"Good enough, but too expensive to afford."
Very Comfy shoes! Really nice and warm to wear. You can use it in any kind of weather even in water and dry activities. Really nice customer service also.
ordered football boots on Saturday night - cheaper than anywhere else - were delivered by Monday - superb service!
Love my Nike React running shoes! The react technology is perfect for working out at the gym. It’s responsive and truly a comfortable shoe! May not wear the ultraboosts for a while 😎
Placed my fourth order today and I absolutely love this website. Free delivery and free returns too! Absolute gem!
My  third order with Nike.com free shipping  and free returns no problems.
"Got joggers for running, amazing piece!!"
"Had a very good order with Nike again .Even  when there’s a problem with Nike they always atleast try ,witch is always appreciated!  defo order from Nike direct if they have your product they always try to help you"
"Best customer service, give me the solution in a short period of time"
I've tried several sneaker brands since the early 90s. None seem to fit like Nike. I can always find something I like at a decent price.
I just bought a pair of shoes today and they offered me free shipping and returns. They always know how to treat their customers with respect. Thanks Nike.
"Not the best customer service. Plus, I think they should indicate that the shoes are not really made in USA, at least, not the one I Bought. But, even so, shoes are great."
Happy to be served by them. Best service ever. Top of the class products.
"The delivery was so quick I didn't expect that, thanks guys, really appreciate your service"
"very on time delivery (in England). I have got refunded several times as I did not feel comfortable on some ordered shoes. They have also various discounts and even some specific one for students for which, as a student, I admire them."
I give 3 stars only because i finally received my order! The delivery took ages and its bery hard to get in touch with their support
Fantastic Shoes. Recently bought a few pairs from their online store and they are excellent quality. No delays in delivery. All round fantastic service.
I have several types of football boots from Nike.I bought one expensive pair which I had used once and wasn't suitable for my playing experience and I this explained to them. I politely asked for a exchange / refund and they were really prompt in offering a refund and also paying it back to my card.It's when there is a slight problem a company's customer service is properly tested and I was most appreciative.Because of that I look forward to using those funds to buy a different pair of Nike football boots.
These shoes are the best! Good design and high quality material. The Nike Jordans are very special in my collection.
"Ordered the new football pants off here and got it yesterday. The fit was perfect and their size guide and general tips are accurate. Customer service is really good. At all stages of the ordering and shipping, the customer service was helpful in sharing information that you can't see on the website (Tracking won't show till it is in your country). The only flip side is shipping to NZ is very arbitrary (3-12 days) and mine came in 10 days. Wish they could do it sooner considering that shipping is being paid for by the customer. Also, not much difference between Standard and Express in terms of shipping time but way more expensive. Overall, great experience, great product, accurate but slightly long shipping duration."
Never had a single problemGreat customer service quick deliveries
"I purchased the Easter Edition Jordans not knowing they were green. Wore them for 4 hours, and still they took a full return of $185 and then I was able to use my gift card for 2 brand new uptowns shipped 2 day air, no cost. Nike.com is the best."
Never had a problem Free fast deliveryExcellent as always
Made an order of 2 Jordans and Air Force 1s got them within 3 days of placing the order.Swift response from customer care also.But if they can improve the quality of tracking the items immediately after making payments and also make the response to be as quick even if your order is a standard deliver not only for express orders.That would be great.
The customer service is great. I would recommend ordering from their website. I think it's overall a good experience for me.
"Customer service poor on this transaction, I feel they need to improve"
"I really recommend this site. Very good customer support, fast delivery just good in general"
"I buy online from Nike & regularly use the SNEAKRS app. Never had a problem with quality of product or delivery. Items are sent double boxed & are box fresh having never been tried on, because I know they fit true to my size, this is perfect for me.Nike, you only get 4 stars as the SNEAKRS app raffle system is flawed I’m afraid. I know you have been trying to tackle the bots & multi account resellers, but it just isn’t working. I’m not bitter because I have plenty of L’s because I realise if there was another way I still may lose! However, check eBay as soon as a raffle closes & you’ve notified winners & there’s a multitude of listings, sometimes 10x market value. It’s a free market economy, resellers are healthy to some extent driving hype for you & not everyone can win but maybe introduce a loyalty bonus for the raffle, whereby your loyal, regular buying public at least get a better chance for all the £’s or $’s they’ve spent to actually wear the kicks at original ticket price."
"All of my Nike products are always extremely durable, fantastic. I have Loads of Nike products and all are very high quality"
"I like Nike Uk store really much.Very fast delivery, good service and products! There are disconts for students. I like it!"
"I have always used nike (GB) and have never had an issue! I buy for myself, my partner, my son and friends from here.. Clothes, hats, and trainers! Everything has always come on time, in the correct colour and size and perfect condition! Would 100% recommend Nike! Also, if you can’t find what you need, you can go to your local Nike store (if you have one) and they will do it all for you! Fantastic company!"
"Shopping online with Nike.com has always been easy and trouble free. My latest purchase was received exactly 48 hours after placing the order.  Safely delivered by DPD within the promised timeslot, by a nicely presented well mannered happy delivery agent. The quality of my Nike purchase, as expected, is truly exceptional and lovely ""box-fresh"" from the warehouse, guaranteed not to have been ""tried on"" by anyone else but me.  Much better than shopping in-person in-store.From placing my order there were lots of email updates & then a tracking reference for DPD to arrange a personal delivery timeslot.  Could not ask for better. Absolutely perfect Service & exceptional product.  Truly FIRST CLASS !!  Highly recommended 😀👍"
"I have tried ordering three things, three different times. The first time, I had forgotten my street address (since it was on my app I had put it in LONG ago and apparently forgotten) So, I didn’t know that I did that. I found out the next day because of tracking information.I talked to someone and they couldn’t have been nicer! In fact, I’ve talked to customer service at least 4 different times and I couldn’t have been happier.Anyways, they were going to give me next day shipping for free, because of the mess up. I ORDERED AGAIN, but forgot to change the address. Man, I was feeling really stupid after this.Why try to order another time? I’m just going to mess it up. I did though, and received it a day earlier than was told, except my hoodie. I talked to someone AGAIN and they’re re-shipping it to me with next day air shipping for free.Even though I had a terrible headache of a time with it, I am very happy with the product and the way they treat their customers. Definitely shopping again."
"THEY SAID I WAS UGLY!- (no clickbait)  STORY TIME.I was told by many friends that Nike was a good product. I am sad to report that Nike is probably the worst company that I have ever attempted to use.I Attempted to by a hoodie online but 5 weeks later, I have yet to receive the product. When contacting the company I was told that ugly people do not get hoodies. I was offended but not surprised. I am pretty ugly. I would not recommend using Nike as they will probably give you bacon. I am now very happy using Nike's main rivals, Lonsdale.I will forgive Nike if they give me 5000 V-Bucks.Thank you for reading.P.S- Using Nike is a hard time but the product quality is good. Words no needed."
Excellent service. I usually order my shose onine and I never had any problems
"Ordered many items from Nike over the last few years - delivery is always prompt and the returns process is smooth.I absolutely love the usability of both the Nike and Sneakrs apps, from the ease of purchase to the notification of new show releases. What's even better is each pair of shoes comes with a 2 year manufacturer guarantee!Keep up the great work."
"Nice company, love their products!"
"Well, Nike is Nike, nothing else to say!Amazing service and shoes, will buy again!"
Great service! Wouldn’t except anything less from Nike .
Not really pleased with the experience. Could definitely amp up their game.. it's NIKE..
Amazing Shoes. Have recently bought a few pairs from their online store and they are excellent quality. Keep up the good work Nike!
great store - i would buy here again
Overall good experience but customer service can be better!
Love Nike and my new outfits!! customer service was good too
"I am amazed by their company, quality at its best, quick transaction. I purchase a rubber shoes and it is gorgeous. I really enjoyed shopping on their site !! keep up the good work guys!"
Great trainers and very cheap they have a wide variety to offer
"Have made a few purchases and always a great service. My first order I had an issue with the new eircode post code but a customer service agent was in contact within hours with a solution. Fast delivery, it’s free. Great choice of products. Overall great service."
Excellent at all levels. Ordered many items. All delivered fast. Even returned some and refund was super quick. Very happy so far
"Never had a problem with Nike uk 🇬🇧 To be fare I’ve never had to return any items bought. I never go with recommendations of smaller sizes or bigger sizes I always just go with my usual. I’ve ordered both next day delivery and just regular delivery and I have no complaints, even when things have been sent from the Netherlands 🇳🇱. I will continue to buy from Nike as most thing are of high quality"
Nike is a shoe everyone must experience comfort and style your sure to want to walk some miles and at the end of the day thank your shoes your back will
Top quality shoes. I am a loyal customer and i never had a bad experience. The best men's athletic brand.
"I have never bought anything from Nike online but as far as my experience in store goes I’ve always been very happy with the quality of Nike products. The friendly and approachable members of staff also add to my positive experiences with this company, especially in my local Liverpool branch. I’ve got a range of their training leggings which are the best fit out of many of the brands that I’ve tried, with thick fabric that washes well and stays looking good for a long time- in spite of frequent wear.  I’ve also had my Nike trainers for about five years and they’re still very comfortable and look relatively new despite again being frequently worn.  Just buy things in store rather than relying on line to avoid potential disappointment with online customer services."
"I bought a Nike shoes, I'm quite satisfied and the shoes are high quality."
"Best customer service experience, if you have any issues with any items give them a call the rectify the issue immediately 5 stars!!"
"Fast delivery, highly recommend. Happy customer!!"
"Nice shoes, the sloes are soft and comfortable, a nice choice for running"
"Good quality and stunning appearance, srtongly recommend!"
Top quality goods  and super fast delivery  i have ordered stuff from nike.com in the past and never had a bad experience  too marks
Good experience.Not excellent but not bad.
5 stars for Yeezis.
"I ordered 2 pairs of football boots on a saturday, and they expectedly arrived the following on wednesday. The boots both fit, and both the delivery, order and payment went smooth. Not the first nor the last time I order from Nike."
Nike is the most advanced sneaker company in the word. They mix technologies with fashion as no other.
"Nikes are great, I don't know why there are so many negative reviews. I've been using only Nikes, Jordans, sometimes other sneakers like Vans, however, Nike is a benchmark which shows trends and using technologies as no other."
"Fastest way to get my apple watch was to buy it from Nike, faster shipping than apple.Very happy!"
"I ordered 3 pairs of running shoes online and chose to ship them Next Day Air.  I received 2 pairs on time but never got the 3rd pair.  After researching tracking info and email confirmations, I discovered that Nike’s shipping department screwed up.  The tracking #’s emailed to me did not match the shipping cartons received.Nike customer service has confirmed the missing shipment but I have been advised that it will take 1-3 days for investigation (UPS trace) and up to 15 days for resolution.  15 days really??  They already took my money but will take 15 days to come back with a resolution? I am very unsatisfied with Nike’s e-commerce as they can’t ship a 3 line order correctly and the customer service policy backing it up requires half a month.  I thought a company of Nike’s stature would be more professional.-- Update 10/18The missing box got re-routed and delivered 4 days later.  And, Nike sent replacement shoes at their cost.  I will be returning the extra shoes in good faith.  So customer service is good, shipping\fulfillment needs training.  2 up'd to 3 stars."
This product needs to improve their shoe soles.
It's seriously the best customer service. It's like their passion is to provide you with the suitable shoes for you.
"They have some problem but still most of the time they do the job correctly and from time to time they are still making iconic clothes and shoes, so I personally can forget the various problems that do exist."
"Great experience.....I bought 2 pairs of air jordans online in the sale and they were delivered in a couple of days, then i checked bak online the next day when i had them to by some more and they had gone down in price, i went to pay for them but couldnt and upon getting assistance from a nike operative online, she gave me a further discount to apologize for the inconvenience and plus added that discount to the shoes that I had bought the other day!DELIGHTED :) great company!"
love the products it's just the people who distribute suckz..
"Generally love Nike products, nothing bad to really say about that. The deliver of one of my orders was a different matter. Although not Nike's fault and the customer service handles the situation well. They really ought to consider the company they use to send out goods on their behalf. The service from store to door is still a refecltion upon Nike."
Love Nike shoes and all there products.....very easy to shop there online store and they had awesome deals.....and mark downs....great brands too....
"UK store review: Really happy with the choice of courier - DPD allows booking of 1-hour slots and delivery guys are great. Also really easy to return items and get a refund. I returned with the prepaid sticker and got reimbursed within 3 days. One star off, as the website does not clearly state that clothes (at least golf clothes) are sold in US sizes, not UK, so a wasted delivery. And staff on the phone were not aware of this, so was advised it was a mistake. But now that I know, I will continue to get my golf gear with Nike online."
Great service
"Was served by Corinne Tan on 22nd July in Shaw Centre and Was introduced running shoes, Air max. Indeed an excellent presentation done by your staff. Very good product knowledge.Shoes turned out to be very comfortable and light. Excellent product for jogging."
I honestly do not know why Nike has so many bad reviews - My experience with them was excellent!I ordered khaki huaraches from the site and I got them 2 days later which is really quick considering I only booked a standard delivery!The shoes were so comfortable and totally worth the £62 I paid for them!  I loved my experience with Nike and I will shop at their site again
I was in mulund factory outlet the overall staff was good but a person named rahul in staff was not good when i was seeing the shoes he was backbitching to someone about me and whenever i have been there i always seeing him playing with football in the outlet i want you to fire him
"There are bound to be hiccups when purchasing online. In my case the screen showed an error although the amount has been deducted. Though for most this error is unacceptable, as a programmer I know it may be difficult to 100% guarantee that all payment options would function flawlessly.I contacted the customer service online. He promised to check it out for me and did it as well. He wrote back to inform me that it was a glitch and things are back to normal now.Before writing my review, I managed to glance through what others have wrote. Perhaps I am just lucky to have got Jens online or NIKE has made efforts to improve service quality.I would definitely order again online from NIKE.Best regards,Ashar"
"Till date, all the products of Nike I have purchased demonstrated their best quality. Thank you, Nike, for providing quality products. Hope, you will continue your quality services through your products."
"I bought a tshirt online. The shirt looks fine but I was surprised to get a small tshirt in a large cardboard box. It would be a nicer, simpler and occupying lesser space if it came in a flexible plastic packet."
Not bad at all but seem colour not true with picture
"I´m not really a dedicated follower of NIKE, but I bougth myself a pair of Lunarlon runners a while back and brougth them with me to the States, where I had decided to complete R2R2R Grand Cayon (45 miles descendingand ascending >5000 feet twice). Brougth a pair of track shoes, but decided to start out with Lunarlon. And they took me all the way through witout skin lesions or blisters at all! Deadly worn out (I´m 70+) but on intact feet. IMPRESSIVE!!Anders"
I went into the Hay Street Store in Perth to buy shoes for my 11 year old daughter and was served by a lady named Elizabeth.  She was so helpful and explained (unlike other stores) that although they didn't have children sizes my daughter would most likely fit a women's size 6 - which she did.  She then explained a promotion that was going on and with the 20 % discount for buying two items we ended up getting a Nike top for the original  price of the shoes.  She didn't rush my daughter and explained to her the support the shoes offered etc.  Fantastic customer service.  Will go straight there next time she needs new shoes.
I received what I ordred ...Easy siteDifficulty with sizes !!!Ok packageI usually order clothes and everything OK
Hassle free returns and very quick delivery on standard shipping. Product perfect.
I bought a few trainers in the recent sale and had to send back a few as i did not like and one was not refunded but the others were done automatically.  So got in touch online and was amazed and how professional the service was which is rarely the case - thanks Marcus the Customer Service Rep.  After submitting proof of posting everything was sorted.  Very impressed.  Additionally all my orders were shipped super fast and arrived perfectly.
"Fast reliable service. Trainers are perfect, you get what you pay for and Nike are iconic, you can't really go wrong and they have a good returns policy!"
great sneakers!
"Shoes arrived very quick. Good quality, and perfect fit to my size"
"I  come to Nike frequently mostly for my kids but today I came in for myself and I saw KJ at the fitting room she is normally their when I bring my kids. She was friendly as always and even remembered my name, well as I was trying on clothes I heard a male speaking with KJ I assumed he was manament as to how the conversation was going. Now what bothered me was that he was having a conversation with her like that in a area where customers are and how he was talking to her. As I was listening i got bothered when He told her he felt if she didn't get the position she may go off or punch him (why would he say that) and asked her what would she do if she didn't get it her response was genuine she told him she would go for something else that she was bothered not because of that but because she kept getting put off, mind you I'm still in the fitting room then he goes on to tell her that he doesn't have to open a position and he is getting Irritated. Then he further goes on to  tell her how he fought for her to stay and other managers will see she is mad. She again told him she was not mad she was frustrated because she kept getting different answers. I was I'm disbelief he basically told her her job and a future position was in his hands. I waited until I no longer heard him,so I came on out and fighting back tears in her eyes she still asked me how did that fit and if I needed anything. I was extremely upset for her and I said no I'm ok and she told me to have a Happy Holiday. I came home and this was still on my heart so I thought you should know. I'm not sure if she felt stereotyped but I felt it for her. So can you please tell her thank you from me and my family for always helping us. She goes above and beyond and does a great job. Thanks KJ"
"Fantastic service provided, I ordered and everything came like described"
"Ordered huaraches off of nike just before Christmas as a present. Delivery took a few days, nice packaged box and shoes were in immaculate condition."
"For trainers, football boots or golf stuff. Nike is my go to site. Can't beat it!"
We just bought a pair of shoes discounted to less than 50€ and still got the delivery for free. The shoes were delivered in 2 days. The size was right. My daugther is delighted. I admit the colours suite her well. We used the French boutique and I recommend it.
good job nice comany
I placed my order late Thursday and I received my goods Saturday morning I would like to add that the quality of the clothing is second to none
Nike running shoes are the best brand one can buy.
"I am a 54 uear old runner whonhas been using Nike products (running shoes, tops, running pants, socks, etc) for 35 years.  The quality is impeccable, exchanges and returns easy, and the style and comfort unmatched.  A lifetime customer for sure.  Ypu wont ne disappointed."
I have bought a lot of stuff from nike.nl over the years and was never disappointed. Emailed them once about a Nike sneaker i bought 10+ years ago from another shop.. and got an extensive email back from a dutch employer who was obviously a big sneakerhead himself. Made me smile :) One of the best experiences in online shopping. Great in every way.
Awesome on time delivery updates on dispatch definatly shop with nike again
Theres no problem with nike.there is a little annoying thing about nike which is that the football sock boots are very expensive
Always happy to shop.
Had to wait 6 weeks for my order which I was told will take about 2 weeks.
"I recently had my first order with Nike.com for which I ordered extra of the same items in more sizes, delivery was good and they accepted all the returns no problem. Customer service online chat was very friendly as well. Will definitely continue to buy my shoes and clothing items from them. Can't fault Nike.com"
"I could not be happier with my 1st order :o) , Placed my order very late Friday night 15/4/16 , my parcel arrived this morning 18/4/16 one very happy customer great product will definitely order again in the future."
"Good and easy costumer service! Very helpful.Would give 5 starts, is if wasn't for UPS delivery. They need to use an other delivering company."
"Great service, thanks a lot!"
Bad customer service in my experience. Great products though!
"I have made quite a few orders the last few weeks with nike.Some orders had to be returned due to wrong sizes etc-on no behalf nike's fault.With free returns,my account was credited very quickly with my refund.All came packaged neatly.Would recommended ordering from nike.com..."
Really like the style and affordable prices
student/athlete very impressed and with innovative collaborated ideas i have found a new passion or maintain in my own interest as this industry and sport is what i have studied the most.
"Nike products are really good, they have the only shoes that do not  hurt my feet, but I wish they start to manufacture their product back in USA instead of Vietnam, China, etc"
"I love this shoes, but I even prefer to pay it more but get it done in USA and not in Asia ! I mean, how much they pay to the guy that manufactured it ? same happen with apple, bring the manufactured back home !"
"Designed myself Nike sneakers with NikeID.Delivered at home within 2 weeks. Website said it was 1 month delivery.Good track and trace system. So all very good.When i got it at home the colors i designed where not my style.I send it back with NO charge at all.I payed €175,00 and i got back €175,00 and free return of package.The money was refunded within 3 days! Definitly going to design some new sneakers one of these days in the colors i like. Very good service, 10 out of 10!"
Always get my items with great service.  No need to call or contact.  Items come well received every time.
"I recently purchased the brand-new “Nike Air Max 90 Essential” through the Nike website and I have to say that it went very smooth. From the first moment I entered my personal details until the last step in the checkout process, everything was so easy and simple.  I just hope that the shoes will get to my address as quick as the entire order procedure went. Too bad not all websites are as good as this one when it comes to ordering stuff online."
I placed an order for nike shoes last week and they came very fast. The shoes are great.
"I always leaned more towards Adidas..but recently as I needed a new pair of shoes I thought I'd give Nike a look. I really liked the Nike Free 5.0 Flash shoes. So I thought I'd give it a go. I must say that these shoes are by FAR the best sport shoes I ever had! Comfy and light and also neat looking. I think I might well be changing my shoe preferences from Adidas to Nike now..  I'll admit that they aren't the cheapest but then again, when you get a product of such high quality, I say they are worth the price!"
Ordered from Nike onlune as no shops had the trainers my daughter wants for christmas in stock. Used free delivery with Collect Plus so i could collect my parcel from the shop 5 mins away. Nike kept me informed all the way with accurate tracking and fast delivery. One of the only drama free online purchases i have made.
"I find Nike shoes are gorgeous in style, I see everyone wearing them outside and the gym and got so jealous I purchased one. They were very comfortable and went well with mostly everything I own, no regrets."
"I ordered 2 pairs here on the Belgian Nike webshop. They were delivered within 2 days instead of the 3 to 4, so that's great. I decided to return 1 pair. All I had to do was put self-adhesive return label on a box, drop it off at a post office and that's that. No explaining in why I returned the item, no extra forms to fill in... I dropped the box at the post office on friday in the afternoon, and I was refunded on monday morning. I never have been refunded so fast! In short: service is really amazing!"
"I think the mails i got from my experience with Nike.com Customer Service says it all. (My request)""On the Day my payment was recived the shoe came on sale. From 950 kr to 659 kr. So my question is. Can i send the shoe back and get my 950kr. Back And Then order the shoe again on sale ???"" (Nike answer the next day)""Hi Magnus,I hope that all is well and I'm sure you're quite eager now to get your SB Lunar Oneshots!Regarding your request about the price, I will look into what we can do for you in this situation, and although I cannot give a specific timeframe, I will be back in contact as I have further details to give.If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to get back in contact; I wish you a happy weekend in the meantime!JimNike.com Customer Service"". (My response)""Thank you so much for the quick response.If you find a solution to my price request then please write back as quick as possible because i cant wait to throw out my old shoes and put on some new"" (Nike answer the next day)""Hi Magnus,Thanks for getting back to me and I hope that you had a good weekend!As your Nike SB Lunar Oneshots had been reduced by a third of the price, we have processed a partial refund of 290 dkr.

Thank you nike and THANK YOU JIM!!!!!"
"I designed a pair of kobe's and just received them last week, and they look amazing. NikeID is such an amazing idea. The only small issue I have with Nike, is that the ID prices are pretty expensive. They look amazing however and I am happy with them regardless of the price. Will definitely consider getting another pair again."
"I got everything fast, there was a problem with the shoe but it was well handled by the support. I would certainly buy something there."
bought shoues there - fast delivery - good service - shoes perfect
"Got a polo, but messed up the size, so had to return it. Didnt have to pay for return shipping, and received a refund shortly after.Fast and easy."
I love nikes but I miss the shox.
I bought a Fuel Band for my husband..very fast shipping and the product was perfect. Very recommendable
"Great company, great design!"
I just got may fuelband in the mail today and it works great. It was nicely packaged and came with everything i need. I am Happy Happy Happy!!!!!
Awesome experience.
"Not much to be said here, ordered some new trainers online and they arrived very within a couple of days. The best companies are the ones who just get your stuff to your door with no fuss - Nike are one such company. Many thanks."
"I have been buying trainers from Nike for many years, and thought I would buy them from there official store, as they had some new trainers I cant buy in store.Wow, they were fantastic, with a delivery time of just 4 days, which was a pleasant surprise. I highly recommend that you take a look at there online store, as you can buy the latest trainers, before they appear in the usual sports outlets."
"Hello I order a pair of shoes from their website, the delivery was expected to 07/06/2013 but arrived one day earlier at 10h00 AM. You can track your order from the USP site (the company that made the delivery)."
"My Nike Trainer Shopping Experience Nike are by far my favourite brand of Sportswear, most especially the trainers. The extra bonus is just how fast they are at Shipping the products, I have never had to wait more than 4 days for them to arrive. I have been buying Nike Branded trainers for over 30 years, and have never experienced any problems with the trainers. Unlike other brands, Nike branded ones really are of the highest quality. The Nike Clothes are equally as good, as all of my children buy them on a regular basis, they are almost Timeless, especially due to the dominent Brand Signature. If you are looking for great Sportswear, look no further, Nike really are a different Class."
"Ordered a GPS-clock, a pair of shoes and a heartrate monitor.Everything was delivered promptly, but after a while the GPS-watch stopped working. I contacted support and got a replacement. This took quite some time though, so i will not give the highest rating."
Headaches when return products online although they compensate you when they mess up. Product quality is unrivalled and the marketing is crazy. I LOVE NIKE.
"Unfortunately this review agrees with Thomas. I have had exactly the same problems as he has. Made an order with standard delivery between 2-4 business days on Monday. However it took them a good five days to ready my product for dispatch! This was on my week off from work and was hoping for fast (in the 2-4 estimated time) delivery. However I was disappointed not to here from them until Friday. Which meant I would be back at work and unable to receive delivery. The products I received I was very pleased with! Seems like Nike have become lazy, taking a very long time to process my order for dispatch. Even more annoying when ou have to pay for P&P! Other websites offer free delivery which often comes next day when ordered early, makes Nike performance look very weak! Shame."
"Earlier I have placed serveral orders from the nikestore.dk website, and In overall been quite satisfied on the service recieved. But lately I have had a couple of annoying experiences in placing orders from this website. If I ""fall in love"" with any of the goods on the website and want to buy these, I often choose from the possibility to recieve the goods Expedited with UPS, which has a stated timeframe to Denmark on 1-3 days. The only problem is, very often is has not even been shipped from the store within this timeframe. The last 2 times I have placed orders from this website I first recieved the orders 5-6 days after my order was placed. And it is quite annoying to pay 70 DKK for an express service you do not receive anyway. Last time I naturally claimed this fact at customer service and the representative made a cash back for me :0. Latest I placed an order last tuesday and this order has not arrived yet. I really look forward to see, when it arrives. My only recommendation for Nike is to cancel the ""expedited service"", when you are not able to deliver this service - You create falsch expectations !."
"Couldn't believe it when somebody designed me some trainers, they ordered the wrong size and they accepted the return. Just hope they are recycled properly :)"
"I ordered some items which unfortunately did not fit and Nike gave me a full refund (including delivery) and supplied a postage-paid returns label in addition to offering me free delivery on my next order. I ordered other items which i again wanted in a different size and again they issued a refund etc and another free delivery code for my next order. They sent emails confirming the order; date order was shipped; date return received; date refund issued and date refund completed.  Nike offer exceptional customer service and always high quality products, with the assurance of a hassle-free returns policy."
"Recieved a fantastic pair of trainers here , what a brand."
This site is the bomb! but quite often I find the things I want to buy are out of stock.
